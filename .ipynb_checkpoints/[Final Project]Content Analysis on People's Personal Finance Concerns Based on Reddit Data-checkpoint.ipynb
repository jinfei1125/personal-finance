However, Reddit has a limitation that it will only have at most ~1000 posts in each category (which is far more than a real person's reading ability) But it's not enough for computational analysis, especially for dynamic topic analysis in the later part. There are archived Reddit data on Google's Big Query platform, but it has stopped updated since 2019. So I decide to study the latest reddit post for the most part of this project, and use the archived historical reddit data in the dynamic topic modeling analysis."
