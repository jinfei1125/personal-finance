Can't decide how to allocate 80k towards debts,"&amp;#x200B;

Throwaway account for privacy reasons... So I recently sold my townhouse and along with my previous savings have around 80k in a high interest savings account.  My plan was to pay off my car and 1 student loan and save the rest.  I usually have around 35k in savings so originally wanted to keep at least that much, but i have been thinking of just paying off my massive student loans instead so looking for some advice.  other info: I will be taking a pay hit for the next year for a new job and will have just enough to cover expenses with nothing extra for savings. I will also be receiving vacation payout of around 10k net when I quit my current job. Here's what I'm looking at:

Assets:

Cash: 79,000

Roth IRA: 12,000

401k: 80,000

Debts:

Car: 23,000  / 2.9%

Student Loan 1: 13,000  / 5.5%

Student Loan 2: 78,000  / 5.25%

&amp;#x200B;

So I could just wipe out all my student loans for good, but I would have basically no savings.  I think some kind of combination would be best I just can't pull the trigger on anything.  I also may have to use savings to continue my car payments for the next year until my pay bump which is why i wanted to pay it off.  Any advice very appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coapb6/cant_decide_how_to_allocate_80k_towards_debts/,1565395415,personalfinance
Call from Debt Collectors? Best Way to Proceed?,"I received a voicemail from Chapman Financial Services this morning stating debt collectors are trying to reach me to collect a debt, this is the first I have heard from them. I haven't received any letters, emails, or other phone calls before this.

They called from an unknown number so my phone marked it as scam automatically, but they left a number in the voicemail to call back for more information. 

I do owe a couple hundred dollars in missed student loan payments within the last year that I haven't been able to start repaying yet, would they be coming for that already? 

Should I call the number listed in the voicemail for more information next business day? 

I am very financially ignorant and scared of what this could entail in the future.

EDIT: I do NOT know what debt they are calling about and would like to find out if it is legitimate or not, is there any way to check if I have existing debts I might not know about?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coapg7/call_from_debt_collectors_best_way_to_proceed/,1565395439,personalfinance

Worth buying a 2000 Nissan Maxima for $950?,"I am a student and desperately need a car for groceries and moving around my area. I am on a very tight budget for a car. Recently, one of my friend told me that his boss wants to sell his used car which is a 2000 Nissan Maxima. The car has 110k miles on it. From the exterior, the car looks fine. It has a bruise/ dent on the right side. However, the car looks fine because of the caring and single owner of the vehicle. From the inside, however, the seat covers are torn out and it's very dirty because it hasn't been used for a year or so. Will it be a good deal if I buy the car ? I want to do some basic maintenance like changing the seat cover and making the interior look usable. Since I am on a tight budget, I will have around $1000 for the car and another $500 to repair the interior and some parts change. Given that this Nissan Maxima has 110k miles on it and is used by a single owner with no reported accidents, is it worth buying this car ?

I will show pictures through this link:

Can I owe debt to a collector but not their client?,"This is a bit of a confusing situation so I apologize and I hope that this all makes sense.

A year ago I went to the ER and ended up incurring a charge of \~1500 dollars. It did take me a while to pay since I just kept putting it off (not good I know). After a while they send me a letter asking me to pay or they will give the debt to a debt collector. After that I went in and made my last payment. I did very much miss the deadline by two weeks or so, but I did pay back every cent the website said I owed.

A month later I get a bill from the debt collection agency claiming that I still owed \~600 to the hospital. I called the hospital at this time and they told me I didn't owe them anything and they ALSO said that they didn't have any record of the debt being handed to the collection agency. I figure this is the end of it, either thinking this is a scam or a mistake, and let it go again.  Fast forward to now which is about 4 months later. I get another letter from the same debt collection agency.

I'm a little worried now so I look up the agency's name on google (United Consumers) and it seems to be a legit company so now I don't know what to think.

By paying the last bit of payment to the hospital too late, have I screwed myself into a double-charge? Am I obligated to pay this debt to the agency?

I haven't talked to the agency yet, since I am unprepared and was hoping to get advice before they bully me into paying something I might not need to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coaxh0/can_i_owe_debt_to_a_collector_but_not_their_client/,1565396615,personalfinance
"So, I think my landlord forgot to deposit my rent check?","Long time lurker here, and first time poster. I’ve been checking out this subreddit for a good while now in an attempt to help get my financials back on track after a serious financial, emotional, and scholastic derailment. Hopefully, y’all will be able to help me out with this predicament. 

I am close with my property managers at my apartment complex, and in early June, I gave them a check for June‘s rent and some of the deposit. 

(There was a mixup when I signed the lease and I only gave them half at the deposit at that time, so I’m paying it now little by little). 

They generally cash their checks at the end of the week, and I gave it to them on a Monday or Tuesday (prior to it being due). I told them I would definitely be getting paid during the week, but if they could hold off until depositing it until Friday (still prior to the due date), that would be good for everyone. They agreed. 

Well, due to an unexpected issue with my paycheck, I had to write them a new check for just the rent and not the partial deposit. They went to give the first one back to me, but then we all agreed that we would use what was originally the June check (for rent and partial deposit) for my July rent. They kept it, and agreed to deposit it at rent time in July unless I said otherwise. 

Well, they never did. I didn’t realize until about two weeks later, when I saw that I still have the money in my account. I didn’t mention it when I saw them around that time, because I was a little below my balance, and that would have bounced my check. I have since then balanced out my account again, but my August rent is about to be due, and they still haven’t cashed July’s check. I won’t have enough for both. 

So, what should I do? Should I remind them, or should I just go on like nothing’s amiss? Will I likely get in trouble for them not cashing the rent check earlier?

I know it sounds super shitty, but I’m having a really, really rough time right now, financially-speaking. That money would be a godsend, but I’m trying not to touch it, and I’m constantly monitoring my bank account and trying to juggle my bills and automatic debits to make sure I don’t screw myself over and have the check bounce. 

Advice would be wonderful. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cob287/so_i_think_my_landlord_forgot_to_deposit_my_rent/,1565397293,personalfinance
OK to make estimated quarterly Fed. income tax payment to IRS in Q3 only?,"Just used IRS's W-4 calculator and saw that I'll owe like $11K in taxes. My W-4 for the entire year has had allowance set to 0, so not sure why I'll owe so much. Maybe because I'm in high income tax bracket and bonuses are withheld at a rate lower than my income tax bracket.

I want to only owe about $6K in taxes, because that way I'd meet the safe harbor rule so no tax penalty. Is it okay if I make a $5K estimated quarterly payment today (Q3), and not pay any quarterly estimated tax in Q4? I didn't pay quarterly estimated tax in Q1 or Q2 this year.

I've never paid quarterly estimated taxes before, so I'm not sure if IRS will be suspicious if I only make 1 quarterly payment during the entire year. Almost all my income is from W-2. I will only have about $2K income as a sole proprietor this year.

Extended warranty refund,"I have a few questions. I recently sold my car and was promised and quoted to get the money back from my extended warranty refunds 4 refunds totaling out to be 2,800 dollars. They said it would take 4-6 weeks for the refunds to finalize and I have a check.

So I called the warranty companies and two of them said they’ve been processed and the dealership should have them by now, and the last one that makes up the most of the total refund said they haven’t received anything from the dealership, and that I need to contact the dealership.

Do student loans or credit card debt take precedence?,"I tried looking for a similar post that had been answered with no luck, please link if there is one.

I graduated with my bachelor's in December with ~$26K loans (federal, both sub and unsub). I am currently taking graduate classes for free through my workplace which still lets me defer my payment. I know that I should have been/ should be paying unsub but I didn't have the money. 

I also had a hard time in 2018, not working at my off-campus job, working an unpaid internship half an hour from home 4 days a week, and my work study paying off my tuition. This led to $3500 in credit card debt, which I have brought down to about $2800. However, the card closed due to late payments. (I have also gotten my credit score up significantly).

I hope to buy a home in a few years but would like to diminish my current debt. I have a gross income of $50k starting May of this year. 

Is credit card debt more important, or student loans? Or should I equally contribute to all 3?

Note: I know I made a mistake with my cc, please don't lecture me about that.

Tl;dr ~26K federal sub &amp; unsub in deferment, $2.8k closed acct credit card debt. Which to pay first?

Need advice on improving credit score to own a home,"Hey all! 
Married couple 25/27 here with 2 kids, 3 kids in February. We rent currently and are desperate to purchase a home (home rental market here is almost nonexistent for our price range). We also need to purchase a new to us car this year because we can’t fit 3 car seats in our current vehicles. One income family who brings in about 39,200 a year gross. Our credit scores are very poor, for kind of different reasons. I had one credit card in college that I ran up a high balance on, and then let go completely- it has been closed (which I now know was stupid- I was a stupid kid). I have some medical bills and such in my report, but the other thing is $5500 in principal in student loans that are in default (I have been rehabbing them and they will be back into regular standing October 1st of this year). I also have several great marks on my score including a credit account open since 1992 (my dad added me to his to give me allowance as a teen and purposefully never took me off), and positive payment history, two competed car loans, etc. My husband has two closed credit card accounts, one with a $500 debt and one with a $1100 debt, and one good car payment account, that’s it. My score is 540 and his is 574. 

We are living paycheck to paycheck with zero extra income for savings. We are making it but just barely. My husband will be earning a certification this winter that he has worked really hard for that will mean hopefully a 50% raise on our income. 

I’m really hoping to, first and foremost, figure out a way to get just ONE of our scores high enough to qualify for a mortgage. There is a 10,000 down payment grant we could get, if we could get approved for the mortgage at all. Our lease is up in December of this year. I just can’t get a lot of good help from the loan officer person because their suggested solutions have been paying off my husbands $1100 debt thus far. We can’t swing that until tax time for sure. Hoping to find a way to boost his score just those last few points.

Secondly, though, are there any good resources for understanding your credit report and what is highest priority? I have read through tons of info online and I’m not finding the tools to understand it. I don’t really know how to tell what affects us most, how much a score will raise by changing x thing, etc. I’ve been given the advice before to make sure I don’t pay on “anything I shouldn’t pay on” and I don’t know what that means. Becoming completely debt free is relatively far off for us, and I’m mostly trying to improve our credit in order to make our life easier moving forward, and then eventually be in the position to try to clear it completely. 

Thanks for the help!

I use a cash-back credit card to pay my every day expenses and pay the balance each month. How do I factor this into an every-dollar budget?,"In the past my budget has been prospective. I'd get a huge chunk of money via loan at the beginning of a semester, then I'd estimate costs for categories (gas, food, rent, etc.) each month, project those costs across the semester, and keep projected costs under the maximum I can spend each month to stay within financial aid.

I've started getting into personal finance and fixing the big student loan mess I made for myself (no other debt, own my semi-beater car, rent my cheap apartment) mostly through listening to Dave Ramsey, who recommends his Every Dollar budgeting technique. I'd like to try to use it but I'm not sure how to factor in the fact I put everything except rent on my credit card and then pay off the balance each month. And, naturally, Dave has no advice on this since he doesn't support this strategy.

Unlike before, I am moving from subsisting on loans to having my grad work funded and actually earning a stipend, and I am beginning some side hustles as well, so semi-variable income will be a thing again.

The confusion comes with the fact I budget food, gas, etc. and put them on the card, so then if I budget a credit card payment I think that means that the expense appears in the budget twice, once in the month it's made and once in the month of the CC statement? So do I just \*not\* put the CC in my every dollar budget and consider that factored in based on the previous month's expense budget?

(I'm sorry if I didn't explain the question well, I'm just kind of challenged here . . .)",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cobciy/i_use_a_cashback_credit_card_to_pay_my_every_day/,1565398888,personalfinance
I paid off my student loans and my credit score dropped 46 points,"As the title says, my credit score dropped 46 points; I went from 763 to 717. I recently graduated and landed a job as a software developer and finally had the means to pay off my student loans. I had a total of 8 different loans, and I paid them off all at once. I know the number of accounts open greatly affects your credit score, but I didn't realize it would drop this much. 

The thought of a large student loan debt to my name caused me unnecessary stress, so I wanted to address it as quickly as possible which is why when I had the means to do so, I did it all at once.

The problem is I'm in the middle of searching for an apartment, and about to get a new car, so now I really think I fucked up by doing this. How long does it take to typically recover for something like this? Or did I actually screw myself over? I'm curious if I will even get approved for an apartment now or get a car loan that isn't insane interest.

Graduate school advice. Savings vs Loan,"Hey everyone, I'll be attending graduate school to get a masters in computer science next month, but I'm still deciding on how I should approach paying for it. 


The program will cost a total of about $45,000 for three years.
I worked for 3 years and managed to save the whole amount. I'll also be living with family so I won't have many other expenses. Technically I can pay for the whole thing with my savings, but then I would have no cash left if anything were to happen.

Some have told me I should just take out a big loan for it and not touch the savings as I'll probably be able to find a decent job afterwords to pay the loan back.

Others have said it's better to not take any loans and just pay for it. I'm sort of leaning in the middle to pay $30,000 and take out a loan of $15,000 for the last year, which would still leave me with 15k as an emergency fund.

Advice on best ideas for large influx of money,"First this is not a brag post. Me and my wife have been very frugal after being b.r.o.k.e. When our son was born. We’re not well versed in how to handle a lot of money. 

We should be coming into around 100k in the next week (figure 70k? After taxes?). We’ve already decided to pay off all of our credit card debt and spend a little on ourselves. Which would leave us with around 55k left over. 

We’re financing 2 of our cars and have about 31 still owed that we could pay off. Other than that we have our new house (equity is continuously rising so need to bank the money) and student loans (not a huge amount and is manageable).

If we want to save it for rainy days is a reg savings account the way to go? Any and all advice is appreciated. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coce0l/advice_on_best_ideas_for_large_influx_of_money/,1565404804,personalfinance

Social Security: Changing Direct Deposit,"Hi, so my mom is 75 and not in the best of health.  She has a separate checking account where her social security is deposited; in discussing it with my dad, he thought we should move her direct deposit to their joint account.  She really has no need for a separate checking account at this point and it makes sense to consolidate their finances somewhat (trying to get their finances organized has been a nightmare).

I read you could change direct deposit online if you set up a ""My Social Security"" online account, so I sat down with her and we jumped through the hoops and set it up.  But when I went to the direct deposit page, it does not offer any option to make a change, just ""call us to update your direct deposit information.""

So I called the number and answered the preliminary questions, and it turns out it's at least 2 hours on hold to reach a person to help with this.  I couldn't stay that long so I hung up.

Does anyone know:

1) Is the fact that the My SS account is new the reason we can't update this online?  If so, does anyone know how long the wait is before we will have the option?

2) Is there a form we can mail in or some alternative way to do this?

It seems crazy that we have to keep this checking account open forever because we can't change the direct deposit information.  I just do not have hours to hang out at their house and wait on hold.

Made horrible financial decisions in my early 20's and now I need some serious help.,"So, I've gotten to the point that I really don't know the best course of action to take with regard to my finances. I made some horrible decisions money wise in the past couple of years and now I'm paying for it. I have since learned my lesson the hard way and am asking for genuine advice from the lovely people of Reddit.

A bit about my situation:

I'm a 26 year old who is finishing up her last class for her Bachelors in Math. I had a lot of problems with my health throughout the years so my student loan debt is pretty high (\~$95,000) considering I was taking classes when I probably shouldn't have. On top of that, I have accrued about \~$15,000 in credit card debt from irresponsible use. I'm currently on a DMP (debt management plan) because last fall, I severely fell behind on payments and I had no other option but to lower my interest rates and consolidate my payments. However, because of this, my credit score is at a solid 600. I don't qualify for any refinancing because my credit history is abysmal and I calculated that I'll be paying about $1,100 a month just on student loans. However, there is one shred of good news, which is on September 16th, I'll be starting a new job with a starting salary of $71,000 (plus half-time rate for any hours worked over the standard 40). So here are some goals I want to achieve with that new income.

Goals:

1. Move out within a year (somehow)
2. Raise my credit score to at least 650
3. Pay off as much credit card debt as possible
4. Lower my monthly student loan payments
5. Save money, if possible

I'll be honest, I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle. I feel so foolish for not learning the value of good finances earlier, but I was naive. If anyone has any advice whatsoever on the best course of action to relieve some of this financial stress, I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in advance.

By the time all of my checks come in, I should have about 4000. I'm attempting to find an on campus job but that is very difficult, especially with my major (music education). I also need to pay for my insurance in September and February, which will be about $900 each. Then I have a trip to Rome with my marching band coming up in 2020 which will be $3000, and then I want to audition and march drum corps in 2020, which will be about $4000.

A fraudulent credit account was opened in my name. Am I handling this correctly?,"Earlier this week I got a Credit Karma notification that a hard credit inquiry had been added to my account.

Now I see through CK that this account is now listed as a ""closed account"". So does that mean is potentially lower my credit score by adding to my total number of accounts and/or the average age of account?

CK says that ""Total accounts"" includes both open and closed accounts, but is a low impact factor.

They also say that ""Credit age"" is only for open accounts, so I guess this fraudulent account that was open for 1 day wouldn't matter?

Urgent question - air ambulance and bankruptcy,"US citizen and resident of Utah. I was saving up for leanfire and was 12 years away from leanfiring in Sri Lanka or Thailand.

I received a bill in the mail today. Driving distance to the hospital is about an hour, although I live in a mountain cabin without roads - hike to my ATV / snowmobile and drive my ATV to the nearest dirt road where my car is parked.

- one car 1999 Toyota Camry

- 87k in stocks of which about half is in a retirement account.

- 100k in savings account. Too high I know but I was waiting to buy VTSAX when SPY hits below the 280 mark.

Medical Discharge From NUPOC. So many financial questions.,"I'm in New York if that matters.

Up until recently, I was in NUPOC. It is a program not too different from ROTC in what the mid-long term outcomes are but pretty different in how it functions through college. Once accepted into the program you swear in and enlist and receive pay as E-6. After you graduate college you go to OCS and then commission as an ensign.

My OCS date got moved back first because the May class was overfilled. Then I began having symptoms of what I thought was hemorrhoids so my ship date got moved back again. I eventually got in with a gastroenterologist and he recommends a colonoscopy. I had a colonoscopy on Wednesday 7/17. After which I was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis. 7/26 I get the call I am going to be medically discharged from the navy. Today (Friday) or Monday my DD-214 is being submitted to Great Lakes and it is backdated 7/30. I am no longer receiving pay but I've been told it could take a couple of months for papers to finalize properly.

I have

\-Two degrees one in mechanical engineering with a math minor as well as a degree in physics both are Bachelors of Science.

\-$1700 in the bank

\-A paid for 2007 Volvo with the insurance paid out till December. I think it is about $670/ 6 months

\-About $100 in monthly subscriptions I'm canceling this weekend.

\-$11,000 private loan for college.  $141.38 per month payment.

\-$28,759  in federal loans with the grace period ending in November

\-  An \~$18000 Parent Plus loan that I will need to pay, also with the grace period ending in November.

\- A $15000 bonus that I've been informed the Navy will be asking me to repay at some point (probably start a payment plan soon).

\- \~$100 for ulcerative colitis medication per month

To summarize about 73,000 dollars in debt and I'm living with my parents.

\-Question 1 is am I eligible for unemployment and if so will showing my leave and earnings statement going empty in August as well as the submitted DD-214 be sufficient to get it.

\-Question 2 I'm about to describe my current plan and would appreciate any advice.

Step 1 Update Resume, Prep for FE and GRE (Both general and physics subject)

Step 2 Apply to local engineering jobs

Step 3 Apply to Ph.D. Plasma Physics programs, Ph.D. Aeronautical Engineering Programs with a focus on computational fluid mechanics and apply to any fully funded Aeronautical Engineering Programs of the same type.

Step 4 Work at a local engineering job until next summer to cover costs and make payments on debt and really dig into stuff that won't go back into deferment if I enroll in grad school.

Step 5a) Go to grad school if accepted.

Step 5b) Begin looking for a long term engineering job if I don't like my grad school prospects.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Question 3

I've been being taxed like I was going to make about \~49k this year and I've grossed \~29k of it so far and now will be asked to begin paying 15k back. Where does that leave me for taxes?

School bills coming up on the horizon: Do I refinance my home and withdraw some equity? Or do I just pay for school out of pocket?,"I (31/m) and my wife (31/f) bought a house for $320,000 in December 2016. At the time, we thought that there was no way we would want to stay in this starter home past seven years, so we got a 7/1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) at a fairly good rate and negative closing costs (I think we got paid $5000 with a 4% interest rate which is good for the first seven years before it adjusts upwards). We have no children and are not interested in having them in the future.

Recently, we’ve been talking about how we might not want to live here past seven years, but if we held onto this home, we could use it as a rental property and earn some income from it, as it’s in a decent location in our city (Portland, OR). 

Aside from our car payment ($400/mo), the mortgage is our only other debt. We pay all CC’s off every month and live under our means. We don’t have a ton of savings but we do have a 3-month emergency fund. We use You Need A Budget and our money’s age is about 100 days.

I am about to begin a 5-year part-time doctoral program to become a nurse practitioner. It will cost about $75,000 total over those five years. We are saving about $950/month in order to be able to fully pay for the nursing program out of pocket without taking on more debt. I plan to work full-time throughout the part-time nursing school. While we are able to manage this, it does cut down on how much traveling and extracurriculars we are able to do, as a large chunk of our income goes to paying for school. We currently have about $20,000 saved in my education fund. 

Our home loan was made out for $256,000 when we bought the house. Currently, our outstanding balance is $247,633. Therefore, we have $72,367 in equity in our house. 

**My questions:**

Should I refinance my home loan and withdraw some money from it (maybe $50,000?) in order to allow my wife and I to not have to spend almost $1000 per month on my schooling? We could stick that money in a high-yield savings account and allow it to earn more money than it currently is when it’s just sitting in equity in our house… Even just in a Wealthfront savings account, I could be earning about $1600 annually from the 2.32% APY on $70K. But this is where I get confused. Is it already working for me as equity? Is it helpful to have equity in one's home for any reason, for my situation specifically?

My second question is... Even if I decide not to take out any of my equity, would it still make sense to refinance to a 30-year or 25-year fixed rate while interest rates are pretty low? That would help me later on if we decide to use this property as rental income after moving elsewhere without worrying about my rate increasing. I hear it's about $4000 to refinance with closing costs, but if I could get a lower monthly payment and a lower rate, I could potentially save money in the long-term by refinancing, right?

"""What flat-rate card should I get?""","I initially posted this over in /r/creditcards, but I figured that it may be able to help some people here as well.

Whether someone only wants to use a single credit card or multiple cards in order to maximize returns on their spending, it's almost universally a good idea to have a card that receives a flat rate in cash back. Therefore, I've put together a list of what's currently on the market in order to help people make decisions about which one to get. Keep in mind that there are *a lot* of financial institutions, so it may not be possible for this list to be *truly* complete.


**TOP TIER**

If you have good or excellent credit, these cards are for you. That being said, it is *sometimes* possible for people with lower scores to be approved for these, but it is less likely; YMMV.

CARD | CASH BACK % | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
Alliant Visa Signature | 2.5% (3% first year) | $99.00/year fee after first year. No foreign transaction fee. Must join credit union.
Ollo Optimum MasterCard | 2.5% | Can only apply via invitation. Invitations all seem to offer 0% APR period for fifteen months on purchases and balance transfers. *Rewards can only be redeemed as a statement credit.*
Alliant Platinum Rewards Visa | 2% (as points) | 12 month introductory APR period on purchases and balance transfers (percentage varies based on your creditworthiness). $50.00 bonus (as points) after spending $500.00 within three months. Must join credit union. *This card appears to be much easier to obtain with lower credit scores than other top-tier cards.*
Citi Double Cash MasterCard | 2% (1% when purchasing, 1% when paying off) | 0% APR on balance transfers for eighteen months.
Fidelity Rewards Visa | 2% (as points) | Points must be redeemed into a Fidelity account. *There is occasionally, but not always, a SUB.*
PayPal Cashback MasterCard | 2% | No foreign transaction fee. Must have a PayPal account to apply. *Rewards can be redeemed in any amount.*
State Department Federal Credit Union Premium Cash Back + Visa | 2% | $200.00 bonus after spending $3,000.00 in ninety days. No foreign transaction fee. $250.00 in cell phone protection. Must join credit union.
Bank of America Premium Rewards MasterCard | 1.5% (as points) (2% as points on travel and dining purchases) | $95.00/year fee. $500.00 (as points) bonus after spending $3,000.00 in ninety days. $100.00 in statement credits per year to cover incidental airline fees. Up to $100.00 in statement credits every four years for Global Entry/TSA Precheck application fee. No foreign transaction fee. *Points (not counting travel and dining, although they increase by the same proportion) are worth 1.88% with Gold [Preferred Rewards](https://www.bankofamerica.com/preferred-rewards/) status, 2.25% with Platinum Preferred Rewards Status, and 2.63% with Platinum Honors Preferred Rewards Status.*
Chase Freedom Unlimited Visa | 1.5% (as points) (3% first year on up to $20,000.00 in spending) | 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. *Points are worth 2.25% when transferred to the Chase Sapphire Reserved. No minimum to redeem rewards.*
UnionBank Cash Back Rewards Visa | 1.5% | 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for twelve months. $100.00 bonus after spending $1,000.00 in three months. *Worth 2.25% if redeeming towards a UnionBank mortgage. This card is also easier to get than the others, but is not worth it unless redeeming for 2.25%.*

Unless you have *insanely* high spending (at least $19,800.00 on the card per year), I wouldn't recommend the Alliant Visa Signature after the first year; I would downgrade to the Alliant Platinum Rewards. As noted in the table, the Alliant Platinum Rewards actually seems to be available to people with much lower credit scores than other cards in this section.

The Ollo Optimum MasterCard is only a few months old, *and* [it requires an invitation](https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/ca0f21/ollo_optimum_mastercard_invitation/?st=jz4w30um&amp;sh=1f4af732), so finding accounts and reviews of it are pretty tough. Ollo is known as a subprime lender, and the card is issued by Bank of Missouri. That being said, on paper at least, it seems pretty decent.

The Fidelity Rewards Visa is issued through Elan, which is generally considered a terrible issuer. However, the card itself is pretty solid, especially if you can get a SUB. Even if you don't want to use Fidelity for investing, they have a cash management account you could use in order to get the rewards where you want. 

The PayPal card is issued by Synchrony, which a lot of people strongly dislike. In my opinion, it's nowhere as bad as Elan, and as far as issuers like those two, Comenity, etc go, it's the best.

The Bank of America card is only worth consideration *as a flat-rate card* if one has Platinum Honors status and enough spending to justify the annual fee over one of the other cards (*not* factoring in the travel and dining rewards, how you value the various statement credits and travel perks, etc).

The Chase Freedom Unlimited comes out ahead of the 2% cards if transferring points to the Chase Sapphire Reserve. If you transfer to the Chase Sapphire Preferred, however, the 2% cards come out ahead. If you *aren't* going to transfer, this probably isn't worth it, unless you're just trying to build a relationship with Chase--hopefully while hoarding the points--before getting the CSR or something.

Do not get the UnionBank card unless you have a UnionBank mortgage and want to redeem your rewards towards it.

All of this being said, the PayPal CashBack MasterCard and the SDFCU are *probably* the best options as far as the 2% cards go, especially since the Citi Double Cash had a lot of its benefits removed. If you have a decent credit score, don't have and don't want the CSR, and you can't get or it doesn't make sense to get one of the 2.5% cards, these and *maybe* the Fidelity are likely the best.

**SECOND TIER**

Not everyone can get the cards in the top tier. However, there are still options for those who fall a bit short in the credit score department.

CARD | CASH BACK % | NOTES
:-- | :-- | :--
American Express Cash Magnet | 1.5% | 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. $150.00 bonus after spending $1,000.00 in three months. 
BBVA Rewards Visa | 1.5% (2% with $1,000.00+/month in deposits to a BBVA checking, savings, or money market account) | 0% APR period on balance transfers for thirteen months. $100.00 bonus after spending $1,500.00 in ninety days
Capital One Quicksilver MasterCard | 1.5% | 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. $150.00 bonus after spending $500.00 in three months. No foreign transaction fee.
HSBC Cash Rewards MasterCard | 1.5% (3% first year on up to $10,000.00 in spending) | 10% anniversary bonus on all points earned each year. 0% APR period for twelve months on purchases and balance transfers.  No foreign transaction fee.
Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa | 1.5% (1.8% on certain mobile wallets for the first year) | 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers for fifteen months. $150.00 bonus after spending $500.00 in three months. $600.00 in cell phone insurance. *Rewards can be redeemed at Wells Fargo ATMs.*

The BBVA Rewards Visa is only worthwhile if you're able to meet the qualifications to get the 2%. 

The average score for approval on the Quicksilver appears to skew a little bit higher than other cards in this section. That being said, Capital One *seemingly* is more likely to approve you if you're carrying a balance, so if you have a 0% APR period on another card that you could use for that purpose, it may help.

The HSBC card is pretty interesting, although HSBC has been known to be a difficult lender to deal with. In addition, the scores that people get approved with for this card appear to be *right* on the bubble for the point at which one could get something better.

If you want the $600.00 in cell phone insurance and don't have or want the Uber Visa or the Wells Fargo Propel American Express or something like that, the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa may be worth getting even if you *don't* want it as your flat-rate card.

Overall, these aren't *bad* cards, but the cards on the previous list are generally preferable in most scenarios. That being said, a lot of these have pretty easy SUBs, so they may be worth considering if you're looking for one.


**THE REST**

I won't even bother with a table for these, since there are *very* few situations in which these would be your best option for a card.

The first of these are cards that *could* be considered for the second tier, but, with the credit scores, hoops to jump through, etc required to get them (or to get a higher rate), they're just not worth it in most situations. This includes the Citizens Bank Cash Back Plus World MasterCard (1.8%), the M&amp;T Visa Signature (1.5%), the KeyBank Key Cashback MasterCard (1.5%, 2% with $1,000.00+/month in deposits into a KeyBank checking account *and* a minimum of $1,000.00 in a KeyBank savings or investment account), the PenFed Power Cash Rewards Visa Signature (1%, 2% for PenFed Honors Advantage members), and the Schwab Investor American Express (1.5%).

Beyond these, there are *tons* of other 1.5% cards out there. Overall, these aren't as good as the other 1.5% cards listed, due to smaller or no SUBs, short or no 0% APR periods, etc. These should only really be considered if one has no better options and either wants or needs a flat-rate card: Cadence Maximum Rewards Visa, Capital One QuicksilverOne MasterCard (has a $39.00/year fee, which is the main difference between it and the Quicksilver), NASA Federal Credit Union Platinum Cash Rewards Visa, and U.S. Bank Cash 365 American Express.

Beyond *these*, Elan has a white label credit card suite that includes a 1.5% cash back Visa card that several smaller financial institutions use. Off the top of my head, Ameris Bank, Bryant Bank, Flagstar, Incredible Bank, Renasant, and Valley National all use them. They are labeled as *Financial Institution* Real Rewards Visa. These should also only really be considered if one has no better options and either wants or needs a flat-rate card.

Truthfully, the Discover It Miles functions essentially like a 1.5% cash back card (3% in the first year), and is *probably* a better choice than anything in this section.


**CONCLUSIONS**

As you can see, there are a lot of options out there, which can be extremely confusing to many people. Hopefully, this makes things a bit more clear for at least a handful of people.

Can someone explain to an euro guy how American credit cards work.,"I’m from Europe and with my credit card everything I pay with it is being withdrawn from my bank account at the end of the month without any fees or interest. 

Since the Apple Card came out I’ve heard a lot about credit cards in America and I keep wondering how the American system of credit cards work. 

For example I keep reading you have to pay 23% interest and people make a really big deal out of it. Why would anyone pay interest rates of 23% or more? 

Can someone explain how the whole system works since it’s clearly different from what I’m used to.

What to do with some properties.,"I own two properties, they are both 5 acres. I don't have anyone in my life I can ask for help or ideas, so I am asking the online community for some, or a possible lead on who to talk to in my town that I could work with to find out what would benefit the community as well.

They are both located in Michigan near the center of the lower peninsula, so snow is on the ground for a good 4-6 months.  

The first one is located semi out of a town about 10 minutes away, this property is more a square shape with the only driveway going past a neighbors house, both properties use the same driveways. As said it is 5 acres, surrounded by woods, with plenty of trees on the property itself. Other houses are probably a 4-5 minute walk through the woods. It use to have a mobile house there but that was torn down. It is classified as residential.

The second property is 5 acres as a rectangle shape. This one is further away from the town it is near probably a 15-20 minute drive and is heavily wooded. There is one house that can be seen while on the property but has its own driveway, to get to the property it through a overgrown path. Unsure of the classification on this one, it might be farmland due to location.

With property 1, I was thinking of housing which it can only hold 2. Or apartment buildings. What I would ultimately like is storage units on that property but I think with it being to close to houses that is a long shot.

Property 2 I was thinking maybe 2 cabins out there that I could turn into weekly rentals or Airbnbs.

I am looking for advice on how to turn these two properties into something that can give me an income, even as a mini home rental. I am in the very early stages and they both are vacant (have no housing.)

These properties have been in my family for around 10 years, and with my dads passing this year I feel it is time to get them to work for my family or to be sold, so I would really like some ideas, advice on where to get started or how to find out if any of my ideas would be a solid investment.

Schwab Investment Portfolio,"I'm currently 18 and just started college. I wanted to invest some extra spare cash, so I opened a Schwab brokerage account. This is mainly for a long term retirement investment (IE DRIP ETFs until ~2060, with rebalancing along the way). Does the following portfolio work for my situation?

- 45% SCHX (US large)
- 30% SCHB (US)
- 20% SCHF (ex US)
- 5% SCHZ (bonds)

I know an alternative is to just use Schwab's 2060 target index fund (SWYNX), but it doesn't seem to be keeping up with the S&amp;P500 as well (maybe I'm reading the graph incorrect) in addition to having a higher expense ratio.

Question about loans and credit cards.,"This post isn't for me, it's for my mother, she's currently getting killed by credit card interest rates. Quite honestly because she gets fooled easily. I.E High interest(24-27%) low credit limit cards, store credit cards, yadda yadda. Her credit score isn't the best but it isn't the worst either, she has 9 cards, 6 of them with fees if you don't pay a minimum amount every month, which isn't enough to cover the interest rates. Her entire balance comes out to $6,500\~ across these 9 cards. To pay each card off in a years time she would need to pay close to $700 a month, which is about $500 outside her monthly take home. Realistically she can't afford it no matter how I weave it unless she puts in 20 hours overtime at work every week for the foreseeable future.

I'm wondering if anybody with more experience here would be able to know if banks would be willing to help here. Even if it were at 20% interest she'd be able to afford the payments on it that way. As far as I can see she can only pay the minimum required on the cards which doesn't help her pay off those credit cards very much and would cost her more in the long run. Granted if she did get a bank loan I'd need to take her cards away and stop her from opening new ones.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cof2go/question_about_loans_and_credit_cards/,1565422207,personalfinance
How to ask for a raise because I am underpaid...through text?,"A couple months ago I came to the realization that I am being underpaid. I've been working part-time in a job that I don't exactly love. Nearly 3 years ago I started out with $13/hr, currently I am being paid $16/hr while the starting salary for the same job at different companies are $17-20/hr with either no experience or 3 months prior experience.

I read some articles online about how to ask for a raise but it's been difficult to follow the suggestions. I waited 2 months for my boss to be less busy so I could request a meeting with her. Currently she's still busy but I asked for a meeting in person anyway. She got back to me and said she wouldn't be able to meet in person this entier month so why don't we talk through text instead....I haven't responded yet because I have no idea if asking through text would be appropriate?

In addition, it is recommended to bring up any achievements or additional responsibilities as evidence for why I deserve a raise. But I don't have the opportunity for either of these in this job because I have to deliver the exact same program as my other colleagues. So I thought about asking my boss for her opinion on my job performance before switching to the topic of a raise, and while I'm pretty sure I'm fine at my job, that might be a bit risky?

I had the opportunity to work full time at this company when I graduated so that probably would have increased my salary, but I chose to only work part time because I wanted the time to expand my experiences by volunteering and such. I also knew I'm not going to stay in this job/field for long anyway, but I can't move on to a job I actually want yet because I don't have the experience yet (which is why I am volunteering).

I do need this job at the moment, BUT at the same time, I am really unhappy with my salary. I have to drive to clients' houses for this job, and I've never been able to cover the expenses for gas and car maintenance (not including other expenses for staying alive, thank god I still live with my parents for now).

Moving from USAA Managed Portfolio to low cost index ETF or Mutual Fund,"Hi all, looking for guidance moving taxable brokerage account from a USAA managed portfolio to a lower cost, low fee index fund, likely with Fidelity or Vanguard.

I've finally woken up from my investing slumber and come to terms that I the fees on my managed portfolio and high expense ratios on my mutual funds need to go.  I am committed to moving these investments as described above, but am concerned with the potential capital gains tax liability, and am seeking to make this move in the most efficient way possible.

Additional data points:

\- Current accounts showing $39k unrealized gain.  Total value in taxable portfolio is roughly $220K.

\- Have held USAA managed portfolio since 2011. Assumption is mostly long term vs short term capital gains?

Specific questions:

\- What additional factors do I need to pay attention to?

\- Will it be better to make the transfer all at once, or possibly better to do over a period of time?  For reference, I am a salaried employee with a recent promotion; likely to have base taxable income of roughly $85K. Next year should be approximately 12K more.

\- Before I make this move, should I \*definitely\* speak with tax advisor, or are the considerations basic enough to more or less research and figure out independently?

Father had a sudden life-threatening emergency and had to be rushed to the ER. Any way to reduce the bill?,"Hey everyone.

For a bit of context, I recently turned 17, my father is in his late 40's and my mom is in her mid 40's. We don't particularly have money issues, but I hate seeing my parents have to spend money on me or having to spend big sums of money on things in general, I want them to enjoy their lives as much as possible and enjoy the money they work so very hard to make. 

Last night my father started having severe pains and extreme chills, we had no clue what was wrong with him and my mom was keeping him checked and making sure everything was good. Turns out, it wasn't all good and he rather suddenly developed a pneumonia. I love my parents, and I just don't want them to have to fork out 5000 dollars for a 1 night stay to treat this extremely unfortunate and sudden issue. Is there anything anybody here knows about lowering the bill just a bit? My dad gets really stressed out about spending a lot of money. I think it has to do with his childhood and early adulthood, and I want to try to keep him from as much grief as possible.

I've gotten so worried over this while I sit here alone in my house which is eerily quiet that I've considered applying to jobs just to pay for it for them.

Any and all help is greatly appreciated.

Edit: I think it's important to mention that we do not have health insurance that will cover anything until the 12,000 mark, so that's pretty much useless as far as I know.

Losing money due to Brexit (advice needed),"Hey guys,

Made a throwaway account as this is a little personal.

I’m 28, British, and I’ve been living in Thailand for the past 3+ years. During this time, I’ve been working online and earning money in USD, which then gets converted to GBP.

Since the Brexit referendum result was announced, the pound has gotten progressively weaker. As a result, I’ve been getting more pounds for my dollars.

The problem, of course, is that my pounds continue to lose value once they reach my UK account, so that’s only a temporary benefit.

I’ve managed to save up around £30,000, and with the pound dropping at the rate it is, I’m really concerned about how much I’m losing, especially since I'm actively converting it to Thai Baht for daily spending.

If I leave it there, it will likely continue to drop in value against other currencies.

If I move it all to a US bank account (I do actually have one), I’ll get back far less USD than I originally put in.

To complicate things even further, the Thai Baht has also recently shot up, so I’m feeling the effects of all this from both angles.

I’ve tried to run the numbers through a spreadsheet but I can’t seem to get my head around it all with the movement of multiple currencies.

Am I thinking about this wrong? Any advice is much appreciated.

Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cog1us/losing_money_due_to_brexit_advice_needed/,1565429903,personalfinance
First time homebuyer,"HI guys 

me and my wife are purchasing a home that won't be built till December 2019.  My question is we are currently going through a mortage lender that preapproved us for 4.25 interest rate as of right now.  It is not locked in and we won't be locked in a rate close till NOvember or December when the house goes through escrow. Should i shop around with more lenders when the house is almost complete? Am i even able to do that right before the house is built? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to get the best interest rate for the house my wifes credit is 740ish and mine is 790.  I live in Bakersfield California so if anyone has good lenders or know of any online lenders that have good rates?  I am thinking of going to Chase bank and seeing their lender.

Can't log into my Discover Banking accounts. Please help!,"TLDR: I've had no access to my Discover Banking accounts since Tuesday, and Discover customer service has been useless in helping me so far.

First off, I apologize if this is the wrong place, I have no idea where to post this. 

I have had a Discover credit card for years, and signed up for their checking and savings accounts about 5 months ago and have not had any issues until Tuesday of this past week. I've got a universal login, so I use the same information to get into my credit card and my banking accounts all on one screen.

When I log in on both the mobile app and actual website, I am able to fully access my credit card, but have absolutely zero access to my checking or savings account. The errors I get are as follows:

Website: 
Discover Bank accounts are currently unavailable.
Sorry, we're unable to display your Discover Bank account information on the website at this time. Please try again later. 

If you need assistance contact Customer Service at: (Customer service phone numbers)

Mobile app:
We are currently experiencing technical difficulties retrieving your bank account information. We apologize for the inconvenience. Please check back later.

I could understand if I had been seeing this error for a few hours, but again, this has been going on since Tuesday; I have had absolutely zero ability to log into my bank accounts since then. I've contacted Discover over the phone several times and through chat support once, and nobody has given me an answer as to what's going on; I've simply been told that they'll put in a ticket, and I should hear something within 1-3 business days.

Does anybody have any idea what could be going on, where else I should post this, or what I should do? I'm trying to maintain my budget and verify my account activity, and can't do so without having access to my accounts. This has been very frustrating and very nerve-wracking.

Which leaves me with around 30k to spare for holidays and additional expenses for the next 6 years. Keep in mind that I probably won't be able to work for the next six years as med school is going to be very time-consuming.

"IS SHE CORRECT? A friend of mine thinks that if you have credit debt, and you cannot pay it in full, then it's better to pay a little more than the minimum... that improves your credit score. Is she correct?","So let's say you have a  card with a $3000 limit, a balance of $600, and the minimum payment is $50.  So she says that paying a bit more than minimum... like $75 or $100... will have a good effect on her credit score.  That the people... or algorithm.. will see that you're making an effort to pay more than the minimum.

Does ""paying more than the minimum"" have an effect on your credit score?  Or is it just a matter of your total utilization, and when you can pay off the card in full?

Conversely, does ""paying the minimum"" have a negative effect on your credit score? (Apart from the fact that you're not going to reduce your utilization as quick.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cogsb4/is_she_correct_a_friend_of_mine_thinks_that_if/,1565435642,personalfinance
For how long should I draw my mortgage? [First time buyer],"I'm at advanced stages of purchasing a small apartment (~500 sq.ft, two bedrooms), a major step of leaving the abismal rental market. I'm trying to figure out the best term for my mortgage.


 I don't know how long I'll live there, but at least 3-5 years. Obviously it's not a family size but my SO and I are less than a year together (I'm 37 FWIW)... I should mention that it's a great property for investment, too, in terms of location and condition.


Currently I'm paying 1400/month rent and putting 750 in savings. These savings will stay untouched after the purchase.


The mortgage plan I've settled for doesn't vary per the term, as the main factor is loan to value ratio (68%). I'll be getting 3yrs fixed rate of 2.6% and then I can either change to any other plan or the rate goes up to 3.05%.


I'm considering paying over 14yrs, which bumps monthly payment to ~1650 *plus home owner's expenses*, which I guesstimate to add ~100 per month. So it's 1750, which still leaves me with 400 savings. I understand it's not fully comparable: now I'm paying for rent, in the future I'll be paying towards home ownership.


My psychological tendency is to be a risk averse person, therefore I wish to end my debt quickly. However a few close friends and family point out that if I stretch the mortgage to 20yrs I lower my monthly payment to 1230/month. However it means that *in total* I pay much more money to the bank: 304K vs 280K.


Simply put, the dilemma is: should I aim to pay my mortgage faster, even at the expense of increasing my monthly housing costs?

maximizing credit points on a shared account without using a shared credit card,"My partner and I recently moved in together. We mostly maintain separate finances but hold a joint checking account for shared expenses (groceries, date nights, vacations, etc.). Each of us has a debit card linked to the account. This works well for us in terms of minimizing hassle, but I feel like we're missing out on points we would otherwise be getting if these expenses were placed on our individual credit cards.

SO, r/personalfinance. What is the best way for us to maximize potential points on this account? I am against a joint credit card until if/when we get married. My current thought is to each have separate credit cards that auto-pay from the account, use them only for shared expenses, and redeem the cash rewards back into the account. Any downsides to this I should think of? Obviously one of us could drain the account, but this could happen anyway as each of us has a linked debit card.

Not sure if relevant, but I also pay rent into this account. My partner owns the home (has since before we got together) and uses money I contribute earmarked as rent for household upkeep. Any expenses over this amount are his responsibility, as he is building equity in the home and I am not. This arrangement will likely change in the future as we're looking at marriage and moving states in the next 2-4 years, but it works for us for now and we're both happy with it. We both have good credit scores (me: 785, him: 810).

"(BD) Is it possible to take out a health insurance and submit claims to an insurer in another country remotely, given that there are no effective health insurance in my country?","Non-native English speaker here. 

Here in Bangladesh all medical costs has to be paid in cash upfront. The health insurances out there in the public and private sector are useless in practice. They cover upto age 65, cover only a few diseases, does not even pay 10% of the medical costs and have a reputation of never returning claim money. Here is a link to the best private insurance company in Bangladesh: https://www.metlife.com.bd/solutions/health-protection/

Healthcare costs are really high here. A day in an ICU costs 80,000 per day for instance, and they will pull you out of the ventilator if you can't pony up the cash upfront. The starting salary is only 30,000 in most jobs with the living cost according to Numbeo is 33,480 without rent: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Dhaka

I was wondering, are there any insurance companies outside Bangladesh where one can take out an insurance remotely like from online and then get the claim money transferred to their account when they need it after submitting claim documents online? Is there any such solutions that would be affordable for Bangladeshi nationals?

Fidelity Just Industrialized the Mega Backdoor Roth,"I wanted to share as I think this is big for making this incredible wealth building strategy more simplified.  

Using the mega backdoor Roth method was cumbersome previously.  You had to really know what you are doing and then make periodic phone calls to to a conversion.  But I learned Fidelity has now worked it out so that after-tax contributions will be automatically scraped every month and put into a Roth IRA.  This vastly simplifies this incredible wealth-building strategy.  It essentially eliminates Roth income limits and opens up the ability to save more like $30k per year vs. the $3k per year in a normal Roth.  I imagine other 401k providers will follow soon (or have already).  If they can manage to auto-invest the monthly contributions into pre-selected funds, that would fully close the circle.

So what is the strategy?  If your plan allows, you can make after-tax contributions to your 401k and roll them into a Roth IRA.  After-tax contributions do not normally make sense to do by themselves, but it makes great sense if you then routinely roll your after-tax contributions into a Roth IRA through an ""in-service distribution"".  The in-service distribution should only be for after-tax contributions only to avoid unintended tax consequences.  And this should be done routinely to avoid any major gains built up on the after-tax contributions which would also have tax consequences.  Once in the Roth, you are golden, free from taxes for life. 

There is no income limit to this strategy vs. a regular Roth and you can contribute much more.  To determine what you can contribute, you need to take the $56k annual 401k contribution limit and subtract any before-tax contributions and any matches.  For instance, if you do the max $19k before-tax contributions and then get $6k in matches, you can then make as  much as $31k in after-tax contributions per year and convert that to a Roth.

Check with your 401k company if this is a doable strategy for you under your plan before embarking on it.

After-thoughts:

I think the standard advice may need to be altered then.  It has often been max your 401k match, then max a Roth IRA and then do more before-tax 401k.  I think it should shift to max your 401k match and then pump as much as you can into the Roth IRA via the mega backdoor approach, then max a regular Roth, then back to 401k (if you happen to be  swimming in gobs of cash!).

For the disciplined investor, the mega backdoor Roth can also help you tuck away one-time upsides like an inheritance.  Say you inherit $60k and want to invest it long term.  Over the course of two years, you can max out your after-tax/Roth contributions to your 401k (say $30k per year extra).  You can make up for the shortfall in income this causes by replenishing the contributions with the $60k inherited.  Over the course of two years, the $60k is drawn down to zero and you now have $60k in a Roth that will grow tax free forever.  And the plus with a Roth is, if you really need some cash later, any principle you have contributed can be withdrawn later without tax consequences.  (Provided the account is open at least 5 years, I recall.  And you really shouldn't do this unless absolutely necessary).",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cohe4e/fidelity_just_industrialized_the_mega_backdoor/,1565439909,personalfinance
Advice for probable Ponzi scheme,"A few days ago I was talking to a friend who lives in Eastern Europe. He told me about how he just made a large investment that will pay a 30% return. He put pretty much his whole life savings of about 50k USD into it about 2 weeks ago and has received one monthly payment from it so far. He was planning on getting his brother set up in it too, but I told him it was likely a scam and sent the Wikipedia page on Ponzi schemes to help explain it. 

I’m looking for advice on how he should go about withdrawing his money. My thought was that if it’s early enough in the lifecycle of the scam he might be able to get something back as long as new people are signing up. The scammers initially said the he can withdraw at any time but it will take about a month to get it out. I was worried that expressing skepticism might hurt his chances of getting the money back, so instead to make up a story about suddenly needing the money for a family emergency.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cohlak/advice_for_probable_ponzi_scheme/,1565441169,personalfinance

"My brother ruined my credit score, what can I do to repair it?","When I was 18, I needed to get a auto loan to purchase a car. No banks would accept me because I was 18 and had no credit on my name. This is mostly because I dont like payment plans and tend to buy things in full. 
I spoke to my family for help and they told me that I'd could apply for a car loan as a cosign for someone else. This person ended up being my oldest brother. A bank eventually accepted us and we got everything in order. My brother may have been the main person on the loan but I'm the one paying it off. 

I had no issue with this and the payments on those are going well to where I have $1300 left.

So the car sale was a private sell and the car wasnt is the greatest of shape so we put a little extra on the loan on top of what the sellers wanted so we can repair it (i ended up not seeing the extra money because my brother took it for his detailing business at the time and i had to pay for repairs out of pocket). So we had a cashier's check/money order (not 100% sure which one) for the seller for what he wanted. The remaining went onto a credit card that my brother had opened at that time. 
 
Well, recently the car that I used that loan on me broke down hard to where Im wanting to get a new car. Knowing this i went to see if i can get approved for a new loan. Its been two years since the first loan and ive been making every payment on time (not going over 10 days of due date). And ive had a very reliable job during those two years. I knew that the only thing that would hurt my credit was a $500 doctor bill that Im nit too worried about. 

So, I got a voicemail from the bank saying. They denied me of the loan because of a outstanding 60 day payment on a credit card and the doctor bill. I knew that the doctor bill should have hurt me much but i wasnt aware of having a credit card or anything. Well, i found out that my brother had me as a cosigner on that credit card that he opened and where the remaining loan money went onto. 

I was not aware of being attached to this credit card. I called my brother asking if he knew about this and he said he didnt. He though he was the only name on the card. I called the bank back to get more information on the card and why they denied me. Turns out that because i was a cosigner on the credit card ($1000 balance in it) and my brother has been paying it off for 60 days, my credit score got absolutely tanked. The bank had told be that my credit score got all the way down in the 400s.

I was livid in finding this out because i was not aware of even being associated to the card and the bank refusing to take me off till the payments are up to date. I dont even know what the payments are on this card. And the bank said even if i get taken off the card, it'll take 6 months to a year to recover. And even then they said if i want to take out another loan when that time comes, id have to have a cosigner with really good credit. 

So im wondering how could this get taken care of? Im really going to have to get a new car and i dont want to get stuck with a 10%-16% interest rates because id be getting stuck with sub-prime loans due to my credit score. I plan on visiting the bank where the credit cards from and ask to give me a copy of the contract.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cohw1e/my_brother_ruined_my_credit_score_what_can_i_do/,1565442901,personalfinance

I have two cards that can split the balance, one will be 0% until 10/2020 and the other 0% for 18 months whenever I initiate the transfer, w/ 4% and 3% transfer fees respectively.

I have other 0% rates that expire in ~6 months, and I'm wanting to hammer those in that timeframe so I don't have to go through this again.

I am looking to purchase a home within the next year. I would be needing a home mortgage and noticed that Europe has far better mortgage rates than US does. So could I get a home mortgage from Switzerland or Denmark and convert it dollars to use for my future home? I'm not an expert on laws but it's this possible? Would banks be open to that idea?

Early TSP withdrawal tax.,"So I have a Roth TSP account. I have left the service and I am withdrawing my tsp as one lump sum. From what ive read I am subject to a 10% early withdrawal fee. My question is will i be taxed at the end of the year or will they tax the money before i recieve it? My tsp at the time of the withdraw was just over $9300. When the money was deposited into my bank it was a little under $9150. My initial thought was oh they must not have taxed it yet, but some money has been taken out for something? Now im thinking that they took the taxes out of the taxable part of my tsp and that I'll have to pay the 10% back during income tax time. Does anyone have experience with this? Thank you in advance!

Edit: 

Thank you all for educating me. I logged back into my tsp and was able to find the disbursement section. Around 8000 was nontaxable so they withheld around 350 for the remainder of the taxable portion. As a plus i recieved about 1500 more then I thought I would so im pretty stoked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coin7x/early_tsp_withdrawal_tax/,1565446960,personalfinance

Job Promotion w/ Travel,"Greetings 

I made the decision to lease a car a little over a year ago. I believe I received a good deal because I was more focused on getting a good buyout price. Regardless, I learned after lurking here that leases rarely end up smart moves. 

My commute to work is about 20 miles round trip so at the time it made sense to get a 30k/39 month lease. I was recently promoted in which I get to travel to our various locations within 12 states. Best part is I get use my own credit card and get reimbursed. 

Total comp will include a $23k raise, $700 a month per tax auto allowance, and a gas card/ez pass. Most of the locations are within the NE corridor. When it makes sense I’ll take the amtrack. But some places I’ll have to drive. 

I have 18 months left on my lease and already at 22k miles with a $0.25 penalty. Right after I agreed to the lease a family member became ill so I helped out on the weekends so i ended up racking up a lot of miles. Well worth it in my opinion.  

My car payment and insurance is around $500 a month. My thought was to put the $700 in a HYSA each month for 18 months. With a 1.9% APY figure it’ll be about $12,780. I estimate I’ll be over mileage by about 10k - 15k so between $2,500 to $3,750 in penalties. So at worse case foreseeable scenario I’ll end up with $9,030 left over. 

I do have a full emergency fund and enough cash to buy a car. I’m thinking of doing the following: 

1. Buy the car at the end of the lease in cash to save the penalty
2. Turn it in and buy a used car for cash. Something newish because I’ll be driving a lot. 

Not really interested in making car payments anymore where I am financially. I have the liquid cash and interest rates aren’t getting any better. 

Any input or suggestions welcomed. Maybe there’s something I missed. Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coj5zi/job_promotion_w_travel/,1565449657,personalfinance

Should we be buying a house?,"We are in San Diego so housing is a bit outrageous. 

Fiancé and I (26 &amp; 24) made 160k combined last year on track to be higher this year but in a bad year could drop to 100k (this is what makes me nervous) 

We have about 60k in savings, he has two retirement accounts through his union, not sure total balances but he contributes 5% and from what I understand the consensus is don’t touch those for housing. 

Student loans recently paid off, only debt is car payments totaling $800, too high I know should drop next year when his lease ends. 

Right now we rent at a discount from a family member, our rent is $1400 but fair market rent of this place is probably around $2700. I think they want to sell the house so we are planning on having to move out soon and weighing whether it is better to pay the fair market rent in a similar place or buy something. 

Our credits are ok, high 600s, the mortgage lender we spoke with said there isn’t much we can do to build at this time. We were preapproved for much more than I believe we should spend. 

I guess my question is are we in an ok position to buy I feel like we don’t have enough saved?

Health Insurance Advice for California Family Self-Employed Decent Income,"What healthcare recommendations to you recommend for 38 yo female, 40 yo male, 1 yo baby. We own our own business and household pre-tax income is nearing $200K including cap gains. 2020 should be similar, maybe a bit higher. We have obamacare now which is silly because we had to pay back the subsidies last year and this year because we earned more than expected.

Current plan is Oscar Silver which is $1,150 / month for family and we still can spend quite a lot out of pocket (With premiums + out of pocket, we spent $20K on healthcare in 2018 when our baby was born). We are the only employees of our business which means we aren't entitled to buy a business plan but we may hire employees in 2020 and could consider this option.

Our expected health needs are: regular checkups; the occasional kids illness; and  I need to see a specialist once every few years. Of course, anything can happen.

For 2020, I am considering leaving the state exchange and buying a high-deductible plan directly from insurance company, then paying high out-of-pocket through HSA.

Software/App suggestions for Personalized Recommendations,"Have looked at a large number of reviews for financial aggregation services, but have not found one that clearly meets my needs, and do not wish to sign up for many to test them because I have to link all my bank/credit card  accounts.

I have a lot of accounts at different providers which I cannot consolidate because they are related to financial products I have, a company plan, etc. Am looking for a website (or app) that will aggregate all the data and based on that, make the following kind of recommendations:

* how much I should keep in savings (if any) vs. investment accounts (and maybe checking), and even better, if it can tell me how much I have missed out on making by having idle cash. Also would be nice if it kept track of what % I am getting in each of my current savings accounts, because I could very easily sign up for a high-yield savings account somewhere now, only to have them drop the rate at some point in the future without my realizing, so timely suggestions on when to transfer money where would be ideal
* suggestions for what to move to/from tax-advantaged vs. regular accounts
* basic investing asset allocation suggestions, which would allow my input for categories (eg, if I wanted to reduce their suggested allocation to a specific asset class, and it would adjust the remaining categories)
- ability to visualize how close my current investments are to the target allocations
- some kind of budgeting feature OR data presented in a way that automatically leads to changes in my budgeting/spending decisions (I have not used any kind of budget or budgeting software before, except for a short stint with YNAB software, before they had a subscription model; spent many hours trying to figure out the concept and start using the software but was not able to do it).

I am willing to pay for a service if it is better than free offerings, and based on what I can save vs. how much the service costs, but am not keen on switching brokerage providers as one is through my employer and the other I have been very happy with the service and fees.

The only ones that I have come across so far that advertise using data to create personalized recommendations are Albert, Clarity Money, and Mint (the latter to paid products they are selling), but I was not clear on what kind of recommendations each one gives and how relevant they would be to the kind of advice I want.

Ultra Aggressive taxable: 100% VTI or VOO?,"Hello reddit,

Im 23 and new, but aggressive, when it comes to investing. Right now, I have a taxable account used for general investing (which I would like to be ultra aggressive), and than a Roth IRA (which I would like to be just SLIGHTLY less aggressive for the time being).

In my taxable, im 100% VTI. 
In my Roth, im 80% VTI and 20% VXUS, and will be until im 30 and I start to decrease my risk slightly and slowly start to include bonds.

Ive been doing some research. It seems that VOO might be a tad more aggressive since it just focuses on the S&amp;P 500, but I could be wrong.

Nursing Degree for three years (150k in debt) or Pyschology Degree for two years (20k in debt),"Hey guys, I am new here and I need some help. 

My parents are not that rich. My dad is a contractor and does not make a steady income. He can scrounge up roughly 25-30k a year while handling the mortgage on the house and feeding for 5. There are some days he does not work and he is in his 60's. My mom does not work because she is sick. 

I am in a dilemma here. I know my passion for nursing is strong, but I am afraid it will ruin my parents. I am also dorming there because clinical are too far away from my house. I am also not driving, I am willing to bike 5 miles back and forth while waking up at 3am twice in a week.  I have done the math and the total for one year WITH financial aid and everything is 55,253.00 dollars. The nursing degree will take about three years. 55\*3 plus (8% interest) seems like a monstrous and stupid idea. I know it's pretty dumb to be in that debt if I am not going to make 200k per year, but honestly the job market right now is not really looking too good with a psych degree. I already know 30 people with psych degrees and they are either getting their master's with it or changing their career because it's hard to find a job with that degree. 

I am 23 and I am done wasting time. I know if I finish my nursing degree in 3 years, hopefully I can find a good paying job and maybe get some overtime with it. I know I will have to be ultra aggressive with the debt and about the time i'm 45, I will finish paying it off. I already bought the nursing attire, books, and I start in two weeks.

Is it a good financial decision for me to buy a condo/townhouse?,"Not sure if I should go for it or stay renting for another few years and pay down debt. Sorry if this isn't formatted great

*Quick overview of my situation:* I live in MA in an area 40 min outside Boston where I expect property values to continue rising. I work in biotech and am in the Air National Guard and expect to gross, at minimum, $80k. My future career prospects look very good. I'm currently renting a studio for $880/mo and my lease has been up for 6 months. (This is actually a really good deal for the area I'm in) I'm 32 have almost no retirement in my 401k because of a very late start and switching schools/careers in my mid 20s. I do get a pension (crazy right?) if I were to stay with my current employer but it'd probably make more sense to jump after 5 or so more years. I'm single.

*Financials:* After all bills/min debt payments not to include food/gas etc I have **$2100/mo left over** conservatively. With my current spending habits **I am able to save $600/mo without budgeting** and wasting lots on food. Should have at least $10k (maybe $20k from bonus/tax returns) in savings by Jan/feb when I really plan to start looking. Credit score just over 700.

*Debt:* $21k car. $5200 credit cards. $35k student loans. Looking to start masters, should not accrue more than $5k debt from this if anything at all, due to TA from work and the guard. Also still have 2 part time semesters of post 9/11 GI bill left.

*Condo:* It is not unreasonable to find a 2br condo for under $150k that I would be happy to live in for several years. I also have access to the **VA home loan**. However, the VA limits my options. Most **HOA fees vary from mid $200's/mo to high $300's/mo**. **Taxes would be under $200/mo.** I don't feel great paying much more than $1200/mo but could technically afford it while still saving, but paying down debt slowly. This put me in a 30yr loan just under %4 interest.  It's also very likely I would have opportunities for a roommate in the near future but wont count on it. 

Should I continue to rent in my not-awesome living situation and just use the extra few hundred dollars/mo to get rid of high interest debt. Or should I buy a condo and start accruing equity buy pay down debt more slowly?

I'm (almost) a junior in high school and I've been working a crappy minimum wage job since February. I tend to be very careful with my money and have saved almost everything that I earned.

Over the summer, I opened a Roth IRA and went ahead and maxed it out ($1055 roughly). I also have $3000 in my savings account and $650 in my checking at the moment.

"Understanding credit card balance, interest and new charges.","I'm wondering if anyone can help me understand when and how interest is applied to my cc balance while I am carrying and trying to pay down a large balance. 

My card has a fixed APR of 12.5%. I've had the card for almost 30 years. 9 years ago I managed to pay my balance down to zero, but fell back into the trap of carrying a balance and accruing interest. It got away from me and I'm ashamed of it. About 2 years ago I resolved to use the card strictly for certain work related expenses, and make payments each month equalling greater than the sum of all charges during the month plus the total interest charge on the balance. 

My balance right now is about $17k. My plan is working though and the balance is slowly coming down. I pay as much as I can afford above the sum of the total interest balance and new charges each month. 

My question is when do new payments contribute to interest calculations? I normally only charge about $40 per month to the card. The interest on the balance is about $180 per month at this balance, so the minimum I would pay normally would be no less than $220, but usually I will make a payment from $250 to $500. So, how is interest calculated if I make an occasional larger charge such as $800. I would still plan to pay the total amount of charges including the $800 plus interest, which in this case might be around $1,020, so I'd probably make a $1,200 payment for example.

Do new charges begin to contribute to the interest calculation immediately? Or, will the $800 charge only begin to accrue interest if I left it unpaid beyond a month? Obviously the same logic applies to smaller charges, but it has a more substantial effect with a larger charge.

I usually make my cc payment on the 15th of the month, but does it make a difference if I pay off new charges I make after carrying them for 30 days, or if I pay off the new charges within a couple of days of making them?

"Yet another ""How much house can I afford?"" question (HCOL).","Long-time follower of r/pf, using a throwaway.

I am looking to buy my first house in a HCOL area. I understand that I am now in a position where I make good (but not crazy) money. That is a recent development, and I have spent many years getting to this position. I recognize that I am privileged to even be asking this question. My wife and I are in our early 30s with two young boys. 

I am well aware of the general guidelines on debt to income ratio and how to estimate housing affordability. I have looked many times at online calculators. This is not a question about whether it is better to rent or buy (almost assuredly more financially prudent to rent in our situation). My question is this. Is there anybody here with a high income who lives an otherwise mundane life with limited expenses but spends a substantial amount of their monthly take-home for housing? Do you regret this decision? My wife and I do not have expensive hobbies or go out all the time for extravagant meals. We do travel several times a year, although that is harder with kids. 

A house in our city that would not require a long commute for me to get to work (and therefore maximize time seeing my kids) that is also in an area with good schools will start at a minimum of 650k. We live in an area with some of the highest property taxes in the nation, so assuming 20% down on a 650-800k house that would put a 30 year mortgage between $4,000 and $5,000 per month.

I don't include a bunch of total number net worth numbers. We have enough saved for a 20% down-payment on a house in the range I mentioned above, and we have maxed all available retirement accounts for several years with a historical savings rate of 30-40% gross salary.

* I have a $17,500/month gross income (wife is at home). I do bring in a few thousand extra per year through some consulting work, but that isn't reliable and I won't include it here for budgeting purposes.

* Monthly paycheck is approximately $9,500 after pre-tax deductions, which includes approximately $4,300 of monthly contributions to pre-tax retirement accounts. I work for the state, so this is the one perk I have. After employer contributions, I estimate about $70,000/year in total pre-tax retirement contributions through a variety of different plans available to state employees. Yes, I actually can do this.

* I do track our monthly itemized spending, although not as fanatically as many people here do. Historically our monthly spending is around $4,000 to $4,500 per month, which includes ~$2,000/month in rent. Utilities are not included and would not be appreciably different if we purchased a house.

* We have no car payments, student loan debt, and we do not carry a balance on our credit cards.  We may replace an older car within the next year, but if we do it would likely be using cash.

If we assume some degree of lifestyle creep (shocking, I know), then let's increase that to $5,000/month expenses. That leaves a conservative estimate of $4,500 left-over that we are currently saving.

Would we be crazy to go from the place we are renting at $2,000/month to a purchasing a house where our housing cost would be upwards of $5,000/month? That would still leave us with about $1,500/month left-over in budget for expected expenses associated with homeownership. Obviously I could theoretically dial back on retirement contributions if needed, but I want to avoid that at all costs.

I am less interested in comments critiquing this as not being the best way to spend our money. I understand this is more of a lifestyle desire than it is a necessarily a financially sound decision. However, what I would like opinions on is whether or not it is possible to do or if we should continue renting. Alternatively, we can save about $50,000/year to set aside for a down-payment and purchase in another year or two, which could give us more room in a budget with a lower mortgage.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cokdzo/yet_another_how_much_house_can_i_afford_question/,1565455539,personalfinance

Changing HSA payroll deductions,"During open enrollment for this year's HSA I wanted to front-load my payroll deductions at the beginning of the year so that it was fully funded as soon as possible. But I was told you couldn't do this, that whatever limit you choose was spread out between the 52 pay weeks. However I recently talked to a new employee who is doing just that, maxing out her available HSA limit in 4 weeks instead spreading it out between the remaining 20 weeks in the year. I am royally pissed because I was recently told I will have major medical costs in the next two months and had I been able to do this I could have used my HSA to pay for it. 

My question is are the way payroll deductions handled part of the HSA regulations? Am I LEGALLY allowed to change my payroll deductions (without changing the limit) how I choose or is this something that is the employers decision? Now that I know that our payroll department CAN do it I want to know if I have the legislative backing to demand they accommodate a new deduction amount.  If this isn't the best place to ask, please let me know what sub would be better.  I just am hoping I can go back in with some legislative backing so I won't have to fight the payroll department along with dealing with the medical crap.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cokjt9/changing_hsa_payroll_deductions/,1565456311,personalfinance
"Job will require me to drive a long distance (80 miles each way) at least 2x a week in my old car, but they are offering to pay mileage ($0.52/mile). Is this worth my car breaking down in 1-2 years?","Hi reddit, I'm new to this adult thing and I didn't even realize that paying mileage is a thing. I recently got hired at a dream job with a 50% pay raise so I didn't even hesitate when they asked me if I would be okay with working out in an office 80 miles away 2-3 times a week. Now a few people, mostly older family members, are suggesting that I made a bad decision, because it will cost me too much in car maintenance and eventually a new car.

I owe about 3k on the car and it has a little over 105,000 miles on it. I bought it about a year ago, and it had just over 100,000 miles on it if that says anything about my driving habits. I've done the math, and assuming I am driving out there twice a week and spending $50/week on gas (I hardly drive, and the main office is less than 1 mile from my apartment) I would be netting like $440 a month which I could just put towards the principle of my car loan, and then when I've paid that off it will just go to savings. Not to mention, once I pay it off that is $100 less a month in bills to put in savings. Worse case scenario, if my car only makes it 1 year it will be paid off and I will have at LEAST $2,000 to put down on a new one (in reality, much more because I will be saving from paychecks as well).

I should also mention I live just about as north as you can get, we have long terrible winters but I have new all season tires so I should be good on those for at least a year or two.

Is this a good plan, or is my family right that this is not a good idea? Any other precautions I should take?

"Type of account that will earn interest, but I can easily withdraw money?","I'm new to handling money outside of using a traditional checking account, and am looking to earn interest on money I have that is just sitting there. Let me explain my situation:

&amp;#x200B;

* Recently graduated college.
   * No debt
   * Have a fully paid off car
* Currently have $1800 per month to invest / save
   * After expenses &amp; spending cash
* I have $6000 in cash that I can invest right now 

I have some heavy expenses coming up in the near future (2 years).

* Ring (\~10k?)
* Rent in SF (\~$3500/month?)

I also am going to be living rent free in one year, for 12 months. It's a bit of a unique situation, but all that matters is I will be living rent free for that time period and I want to save a ton of money and earn interest / profit on it.

&amp;#x200B;

For the time being I can invest $1800 / month, and in the near future will be able to invest $5000 / month. I want to fund this account, earn interest or profit of some kind on it, and be able to quickly pull out money with little to no fees to pay for rent when I do have to pay.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some kind of account I can open that would achieve this goal for me? Doing light research, it seems my options are opening an IRA (not good to pull out money), or stocks (come with a $35 fee?).

My fiance and I are looking towards buying for the first time vs renting and are looking at a first time home buyers assistance program. Unfortunately my credit score is about 40 points too low to take advantage.

Vehicle Opportunity Cost Question/Thoughts,"Howdy fine folks of /r/personalfinance! I have a vehicle question about payments, opportunity costs, and how it relates to the situation I'm in. 

I have a car that I purchased in April. **It was not a wise choice**, though still within our financial bounds, but I want to get out of it. Life is changing a bit for my family and I where I'll be working from home vs currently commuting 350+ miles a week.

A friend of mine is of the standpoint that getting out of payments to get out of payments doesn't make sense. I follow the logic, but want to take a hard look at the math, but I'm not quite sure how to put it all together.

Here's the details of the numbers I'm working with:

* 2015 Lexus RC 350 F Sport
* $40,000 loan (Roughly $6,000 of the loan was from my previous vehicle, and that amount includes tax/tag/title/fees, etc)
* 12.54% APR
* 75 month term, 73 months left
* $780 monthly payment
* Roughly $225 spent per month on gas
* $201 monthly insurance premium 
* Roughly 50,000 miles currently
* Maintenance costs are currently unknown, as it has a 2 year unlimited mileage warranty as well as 2 years of service included. It is a Lexus so reliability long term will be high
* I estimate that just on the loan itself and the interest rate, this car would cost ~$58,000 over the life of the loan to pay off

&amp;nbsp;

**This car is costing me $1,200 a month. Holy @#$%.**

&amp;nbsp;

What I'm trying to figure out is does it benefit me more to sell the car, eat the cost of the difference of what I could sell it for and what I owe (freeing up that much cash would do wonders to put us closer to our financial goals) **OR** do I eat the car and just suck it up for now because at some point in the next few years I'll end up needing to get another vehicle and know there will be costs associated with it, too. 

Again, I know this wasn't a wise choice but I'm trying to make the best next decision. My thinking is sell it and eat the lesson up front then by a cash car in the future for say around $10,000.

Question about which vehicle to choose,"Hey guys!

A little back story. I currently own a 2009 BMW 328xi with roughly 160k miles on it. The BMW will be paid off in about 4 months from now.

Here is my issue. I live in a small town and none of the mechanics here don't even want to look at my car because it's a BMW, they are usually polite over the phone by saying ""we don't have the correct tools so we can't service your vehicle"". So since I've owned the vehicle, I have been doing all of the maintenance and repairs myself (even swapped the transmission by myself).

My main concern is if I ever run into an issue mechanically or software wise that I cannot figure out myself, I'm basically screwed and will have no vehicle to get to work. I can do most easy things but these are complex cars.

Now for the financial question. My little town has both a Toyota and a Chevy dealership with full service garages. **Is it worth trading my BMW in for a vehicle that can be serviced at one of these dealerships, and potentially taking on another car loan?** 

I should also mention that I work in the car audio world, so a high end stock sound system and quality interior is a very high priority for me. I'm also a car guy and getting that excited feeling when I get I'm about to start my car is what I wake up for. I see a lot of different vehicles in my shop and I get to see the inside and quality of parts these interiors use, and a lot of the time I end up having to repair these interiors because of poor quality design and plastics. This is why I bought the BMW in the first place, very high quality interior and audio system.

After a little bit of searching around, I did find a 2015 Lexus is350 AWD that I could see myself driving every day. I have called the Toyota dealership and they did confirm they will service and warranty that vehicle. With the trade in of my BMW and a small down payment, I would owe around $12k over 5 years. (I haven't went into the dealership or even looked at a Lexus yet, just some basic google searching and Kelly Blue Book)

I haven't looked into anything Chevy offers yet (if you have a specific model that I should look at with a high end sound system and quality interior I would love to hear it), the idea of trading in my BMW is still new to me and just trying to get all my ducks in a row.

Another option is to maybe keep the BMW as a personal project vehicle or trade it in for an older project vehicle straight across, and purchase a cheap sub $3000 AWD pickup truck as a backup for when the daily driver is in pieces being worked on.

I guess the biggest thing is - The BMW is slowly going down in value and the miles are continuing to increase. Is now the time to trade it in for something that will fit my criteria and hold it's value longer and be serviceable in my area? Or is drive the vehicle until it dies or until it gets to an issue that I can't resolve and start over from scratch on a different vehicle loan wise.

I will be debt free mid next year, already have 6month expenses saved (and growing), have some investments and recently started a retirement fund. So I think I'm pretty financially responsible if that helps with the decision of my post.

Thanks guys, you're the best! \~cheers",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cola62/question_about_which_vehicle_to_choose/,1565459752,personalfinance
Advice with investing with SEP-IRA at JP Morgan Securities,"Hi! I'm trying to help my mother with her self-employed SEP-IRA by investing in preparation for retirement. She's 45 right now (so 15+ years until retirement).

I've been looking into mutual funds but specifically target date funds (either 2035 or 2040) so that there isn't a lot of maintenance required on her part. I researched and found that JPMorgan has their own ""SmartInvestment"" plans. However there are multiple share classes (ABC, I, R). I'm not sure what class types she would be limited for. My issue comes through JP Morgan's outrageous expense ratios (0.34% for R1-6 share classes and 0.87% for Class A).

I did some additional research and found that Vanguard has a good reputation because its community-driven and not-for-profit. They have lower expense ratios for target date funds which seem to be very nice.

My issue comes, is there anyway I can get Vanguard target date funds through her JP Morgan Securities or would I have to do some type of process of transferring (not sure if this is called rollover or what), and I'm especially confused on how this would apply with an SEP-IRA account (not regular or Roth IRA).

I am currently 23 years old, and have historically had all of my money in my savings account. I currently have $90,000 in a high yield savings account at 2%.

After 10% of my income goes to 401k and another mandatory $700/mo into a pension fund (should yield about 70k/yr in 2019 dollars by the time I retire), I take home about $3300/mo. $1450 goes to rent (again, high COL area unfortunately). $800-1000 goes to everything else — insurance, utilities, leisure, etc. I have about $800/mo left over. 

If you were in my shoes — how much of a car would you target? 10k? 15k? 25k?

Emergency! Someone just emptied my 401(K) account and I can't reach anyone at TransAmerica. They're closed until Monday. Help!!,"So, earlier this week, my husband and I tried logging into my TransAmerica retirement account and couldn't. I emailed them and they wrote back saying they required everyone to make a new account.

I did that on Thursday and by Friday all of my money was gone.

I'm wondering if I emailed a false phishing scam asking why I couldn't log in (NOTE: I emailed the address provided in an email FROM them, not from the website). They responded telling me to create a new account. ""On December 2nd 2018, Transamerica implemented enhanced website security features on all accounts that used our former website. As part of the improved security and enhancements for our clients, you will be asked to register a new online profile.  This will require creating a new username and password, as well as reviewing and updating your personal information and other account details."" It provided a site link with instructions on creating new account. 

I followed the link, created the account, and confirmed all the account was correct. The account balance amount was correct. I added an alternate email address (my husbands).

Yesterday I got an email stating/confirmed they'd received updated email information.

At 3am, I got an email stating changes had been made to my plan. To be honest, I initially assumed it was the email update, however, I logged in to make certain I hadn't accidentally changed anything.

The page says my account balance is $0.00 and that my ""distribution was been processed on August 9. Any applicable taxes and expenses were deducted from the amount withdrawn.""

Regardless, I'm freaking out. WHAT DO I DO? The TransAmerica office is closed until Monday.

Who do I talk to? What do I do??

Edit: I found a fraud alert page and called. They have a voice mail system and the best I could do was leave a message.

Edit: It's not a mistake. I was able to find a withdrawal report. It clearly shows the entire account being emptied. There are fees for withdrawal/taxes, so I don't think it's a temporary glitch. If the transfer was initiated on the 8th, can the money already be gone?

Looking to Buy my first car,"I am a recent college grad starting my new job next week and it's quickly becoming an issue that I have to share the car my parents gave to my brother and I am soon going to be facing reality that I need my own car. 

I will be working in Consulting, so I will be traveling a lot so I need something that is reliable. My salary is 55k/yr and for now I'm living at home so I have little expenses besides my student loans which are going to be around $400/month as is right now. I interned with this company last summer and was taking the bus everyday relying on my parents to drop me off at a bus stop, but unfortunately due to complications with my parents schedules, this won't be possible every day anymore. My office is about a 30 minute drive from my house and long-term I'm looking to move closer, but I'm still looking to have a reliable car for travel due to work. 

I used the car my brother and I share most of my time in college and he still has a few more years of school and he doesn't have enough time/money to buy one for himself. Important to note that this car was my dad's old car, which he bought brand new in 2011 and has since gotten a new car for himself so that we could use his old one. 

I'm looking for advice because I've heard so many conflicting things about buying cars in my life. My parents both think that since I need something reliable I should buy a brand new car but every personal finance class I've taken has said that's a terrible idea because of how much value the car loses as soon as you drive it off the lot. On the flip side, my parents have had horrible luck with used cars. Specifically, the first car that they bought for me in High School lasted less than a year before it broke down. 

Some specific questions I have are: What budget should I be working with? Is it really that bad to buy a new car? What other factors should I consider when looking at cars? 

Just looking for suggestions, anything at all will be incredibly helpful! If there's a more appropriate sub to post this in, please let me know! Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/colqp0/looking_to_buy_my_first_car/,1565461943,personalfinance

My parents' income will be dropping by $3000 in a few months. They have over $4000 in monthly expenses. How can I help them close a nearly $1000 gap?,"I should start off by saying that my mom and dad aren't exactly business geniuses. They officially can't retire (**my mom is 60, my dad is 71**), lived beyond their means for a LONG time before I stepped in and helped them do a budget, and **they have $31,000 in savings between them**\---$30,000 combined in their 401ks and $1000 in a Fidelity account.

In the span of a few months, they've gotten hit with a couple of unfortunate events: due to a less-than-stellar bill of health, **my dad will soon no longer be able to do the labor-intensive work that brings in about $1500 a month.** In addition, a special needs fund (for my mom's mental health) from my grandfather---**which was providing them another $1500 a month---is going to be depleted in 6 months.** It took 7 years for my parents to be completely honest with me about their financial situation---I didn't even know about this special needs fund until recently. **They declared bankruptcy 10 years ago and have had no credit cards since then.**

In six months, my parents' monthly income—and this is after helping them budget and find ways to save here and there---**will drop from $6200 a month to $3200 a month.** Their only income would come in the form of **$1600 from my dad's social security and $1600 from my Mom’s SSI** (she qualifies as disabled due to her mental health). They are both on Medicare. **Their bills, even after budgeting to the extreme, still come to about $4200 a month. This includes:**

**-$1600 in rent**

**-$500 in food**\- my mom and dad have numerous food allergies (including celiac disease), so they have to spend a bit extra on  food including gluten-free stuff)

**-$450** **for utilities** (this includes the oil for heating that they use during the winter, prorated over 12 months)

**-$280 for a lease on their car** for the next 3 years. They literally got this car a month before my dad’s doctor visit. It’s for business since they drive 900 miles a month to make their deliveries.

**-$250** **for all medical expenses not covered by Medicare**\- medications, supplements, copays, and **$50 a month to pay off a $4000 medical debt.**

**-$225 combined for their life insurance policies**

**-$200 for my mom’s student loans**

\-And a bunch of other stuff including household items, pet food and supplies (they have 2 dogs), gas for the car, paying off a Sears store credit card, and auto insurance.

This would leave them **short of nearly $1000 per month.**

I've spent the last couple of weeks helping them redo their budget. We set a firm food budget, I was able to get the cheapest plans for their cell phones, internet + TV (Comcast is the only provider, and it would only save 2 bucks if we cut the cord), and I'm searching for the cheapest generic alternatives to their household items. They've resolved to move to some place cheaper when their lease is up next June. The thing is, **$1600 for rent is considered a steal in the area we live in,** and they **have two dogs they love VERY much which would probably rule out most apartments they apply for.** Additionally, their credit isn't very good due to their **bankruptcy, history of being late to pay bills, medical debt, and having no open credit cards, which would further complicate their search for affordable housing.** I don't know yet if they qualify for subsidized housing, and again, their options may be limited with the dogs. I'm in the process of seeing if they qualify for food and heating assistance. I downloaded the You Need A Budget app so they can log their expenses. I'm thinking of asking them to consider getting a credit card, putting some of their expenses on it, and paying off the full balance each month to build their credit.

I realize this situation could be so much worse, but I'm determined to help my parents live comfortably, especially after their moral and financial support during a horrible time in my life. Can anyone tell me if I have any more options to help them, or if they qualify for the assistance programs I'm looking at (the offices are closed on the weekend)?

Thanks!

EDIT: thank you so much for your input, guys. It means the world to me. I’m currently at my parents’ house having a long talk with them, so there probably won’t be further time to respond to every post, but really: thanks again.

EDIT 2: taking all this into account, it looks like the most obvious choice is sitting right in front of them: move somewhere cheaper. It’s become more and more apparent that my first budget was to help them maintain their “lifestyle” due to me wanting to do everything possible for them after all the years they spent supporting me emotionally and financially during an awful time in my life. These comments have helped me realize that there will be a lot of hard choices and adjustments for them, but if being slightly uncomfortable with new surroundings is the worst-case scenario (rather than homelessness or going hungry or being unable to afford their medications), then there’s no excuse not to act.

Quicken or Not to Quicken? That is the Question,"TLDR: Need to know which online financial management platform will meet my needs: 
budgeting
net worth
downloads from banks
debt monitoring (tracking auto loans/mortgage)
retirement planning 

Need more detail? Here you go

Years ago, I was a faithful Quicken user. Then years went by where I didn't use anything consistently -- dabbled in Mint, poked around with Google spreadsheets, relied too much on my online banking to give me the ""big picture"" (which of course, it doesn't). 

Now, I'm at a point where I want to see our (my husband and my) financial life all in one handy place. So, I thought I was going to head right back to Quicken. Until I read recent reviews. Wowza. 1 star? (And lots of those!). 

So, then I explored Personal Capital - and while it does a pretty good job (aside from the constant ""refreshing"" of my usernames/passwords -- which is annoying when I'm in a hurry), the most important piece that it's missing is the ability to make a budget (and to review where our spending is in comparison to the budget). I don't have time to manually enter transactions, and in a perfect world, the software would ""learn"" quickly where I usually categorize things. I'd also like to be able to split transactions (go to Costco - split up the total between my wine budget and the household budget (TP/paper towels) and the grocery (because who doesn't need a lifetime supply of Cheezits?) 

I'm not opposed to paying for something, as long as it's good. I'm reasonably techy, and admittedly a bit of a PF nerd (I love a good amortization table!)

Are there any Quicken fans left? Is there a reason I should disregard the 1 star reviews? Is there something better? 

I figured the hive-mind might have some insight...

Why do I feel guilty about telling my friends “no” to stay in and save money?,"I (Single, 24 M) live in a place where weekends and leisure activities are based around drinking and eating out. I get a little swipe happy when I’m drunk and that’s been especially true lately (two out of town weddings, a work trip, and a bachelor’s party). I have a two week (one week travel with friends, second week solo) Europe trip scheduled in mid-October and now that summer traveling/activities are concluding, I’m trying to dial it back to save. 

I guess I don’t know where to draw the line on being frugal to save for my trip. If I stay in a bunch this month and the next, I’ll be in a comfortable spot financially to go on my trip and have a small cushion in my checking account. If I say yes to my friends all the time, I’ll still be able to afford the same trip but my finances will be tight (but I’ll still be solvent) when I get back.

I just got back in town for the first weekend in a while and told a buddy no to an in-town festival (day drinking involved, slippery slope for my credit card!). Why do I feel so guilty? Is it reasonable to say no to my friends and stay in? I almost feel selfish. I want to have a cushion when I get back from my trip and still have friends who want to hang out with me all the time.

EDIT: I appreciate everyone’s input! I didn’t think this post would get nearly as much feedback as it did so I appreciate it. 

A couple takeaways:
- Take a limited amount of cash out
- Non-alcohol activities (hiking, outdoors, cheap movies, etc.)
- Pre-game (including food)
- Bring the party to me (cheaper than bars)
- It’s okay to take a night off 
- Branch out to other friends

One thing I randomly thought of today while I was chilling at the slab: I made a list of everything I would be spending money on and attached a conservative dollar amount (e.g., I stayed in today/tonight so: Ubers - $20, dinner - $20, drinks - $20, etc.). I’m going to keep this list and each week pull the money out/set it aside somehow and let it accumulate. It’s truly opened my eyes to how much pointless shit (e.g., $5 Starbucks Nitrobrew lol) I spend money on that truly doesn’t bring me joy. Not to mention, each time I save money it gives me more momentum and invigorates my excitement for my trip coming up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/como5z/why_do_i_feel_guilty_about_telling_my_friends_no/,1565466396,personalfinance

Firestone CFNA Fraudulent Charge,"I have recently (towards the Muggle of April) gotten a charge on my Firestone credit card that was intended for my parents card. We both have Firestone cards and of course the same last names. It's understandable mistakes happen that they charged it to my card, were all human.

This part requires a little background. I'm in the military stationed overseas sense 2016 so of course I haven't used the card for a long time and have had it paid off. Fast forward too late May 2019 I'm deployed so I don't have the ability to always access my email and I get a message saying my account is over due. Odd because I have no ability to charge on it.

Existential Risks of using a Brokerage Account and Holding Securities in Street Name,"Does anyone understand the existential risks related to having securities in a brokerage account.  Generally these securities are held in street name -- which mean you don't actually own them.  There are a bunch of questions I have about this.

* To what extent are these securities loaned (like for margin use) or used for other things, and to what extent are they just being inventoried?
* Are these securities considered part of the companies general assets of the brokerage company that creditors can attach?
* Is it safer to hold securities in your name instead?  How much safer?  How does one do that?
* The insurance that brokerages have: is that federally backed? or just private insurer backed?
* Mutual funds that we all invest in, do they hold their securities in street name of their brokerage OR do that hold them in their name?

Need to transfer money to mother abroad (USA - Colombia),"Specifically, it would be BoA - Bank of Bogota.

&amp;#x200B;

Have a great-paying job in the states (am a natural-born citizen), and have been sending money to my birth mother for the last few months via Western Union in Colombia. This has become tedious and way more expensive than I anticipated.

&amp;#x200B;

While I am ok paying a transfer fee, I am hoping to automate this if possible. I know it's quite easy to set-up automatic payments on the BoA side, but haven't been able to get a clear answer as to what my mother will need to do on her end.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were to arrange a weekly transfer of a couple hundred dollars, are there forms or other paperwork she must fill out for the money to be accepted by Bank of Bogota?

Really Stupid Question about Health Insurance,"It's time for me to sign up for health insurance and our new insurance period starts October 1st. I have a currently incompletely diagnosed autoimmune disorder for which I take 2 daily meds and am also 24 weeks pregnant, due around Thanksgiving. I will definitely be put on a 3rd medication either prior to or after delivery. There also may be complications with the new baby which would require extra visits with a cardiologist that would extend into October.

With my due date in mind and knowing I'm going to hit my deductible less than 2 months into the period, would it be smarter of me to take the higher deductible plan and pay less out of my paycheck or just keep the plan I have which I know covers everything. The difference is about $50/week more out of my check. We're not strapped for cash but I'm not great with money and am trying to be a better adult, also this is our second kid. 

Please don't judge my lack of knowledge about insurance, I've always had a hard time wrapping my brain around it and am sincerely looking for advice.

Also the deductible I have now is $750 individual; $1500 family; the cheaper one is $2250 individual, $4500 family. Not sure how relevant this is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/con2iu/really_stupid_question_about_health_insurance/,1565468319,personalfinance

Avis Car Rental Damage,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but I live in Canada and rented a car from Avis. Stupid, I know, but I scraped the paint while returning the car to garage (love the dense parking) and didn't mention it when returning it. I purchased all the insurance Avis offers (up to the zero deductible LDW). I don't think the credit card I used (TD Cash Back Visa, not the ""Infinite"" version) has insurance, but I do have additional Personal Liability Coverage up to 1 000 000 as added coverage on my tenant insurance policy.

My basic question, to any familiar with Avis or its sibling companies, is will they attempt to/are they able to pull something and not honor the ""zero deductible"" coverage? Their website says it eliminates liability for all loss or damage to the vehicle, even if I'm at fault, so long as the contract isn't violated. That last part sounds suspicious, but could merely be included to prevent people from intentionally wrecking the vehicle.

I have the money to cover the damages even I needed to pay out of pocket, but you can bet I don't want to. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/con6ok/avis_car_rental_damage/,1565468878,personalfinance

From an article about what changes to make when your salary reaches 70k:

""1. Invest in Real Estate — Even If You’re Not Rich

Now that the ground beneath your feet is stable, it’s time to spread your wings further.

Want to try real-estate investing without playing landlord? We found a company that helps you do just that.

Oh, and you don’t have to have hundreds of thousands of dollars, either. You can get started with a minimum investment of just $500. A company called Fundrise does all the heavy lifting for you.

Through the Fundrise Starter Portfolio, your money will be invested in portfolios that own real estate around the United States.

This isn’t an obscure investment, though. You can see exactly which properties are included in your portfolios — like a set of townhomes in Snoqualmie, Washington, or an apartment building in Charlotte, North Carolina.

You can earn money through quarterly dividend payments and potential appreciation in the value of your shares, just like a stock. Cash flow typically comes from interest payments and property income (e.g. rent).""",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/con6wr/has_anyone_here_used_fundrise_as_a_real_estate/,1565468914,personalfinance

Taking a contract paying over 3 times what I make now - what should I do?,"I currently make $14 an hour full time, but today is my last day working here as I'm set to start a 6 week contract in a couple weeks. This will pay me around $43 an hour working 11-12 hour days 5 days a week within my degree field (safety) and will give me experience, so it's a good thing to come across. The contract is temporary, but the man hiring me and using me to contract out is interested in putting me on other jobs. However, for now I'm trying to figure out what to do. 

I'll be moving in with my boyfriend and we'll be splitting rent that's $1,600, so my half will be $800/mo plus about $200 as half the utilities. 
So my monthly expenses will look about:
$1000 rent and utilities
$150 car insurance (full coverage as a 23 y/o male)$50 Student loans
$50 subscriptions (Netflix, spotify, FFXIV)
$20 phone bill

I have about $2200 as an e-fund right now, which is fine for now since I'm living with my sister paying her $200/mo for rent, but I plan on increasing that with most of the funds from this job. Also have about 12k in available credit line, $1k of which is used. 

I should be bringing in close to $2500 a week with this job, and a total of about 12k by the end of the contract.

Not high not low now okay just no credit whatsoever. Until recently-ish when I got into this car I suddenly existed in the system. 

But looking at credit cards now still they are all god awful looking with even worse reviews. And having one really could help out a lot (wife has the travel bug) but i really don’t know what to do. 

I really don’t wanna fuck this up. I’m sick of applying and taking hits and getting nothing. But literally everyone I know who is even half well off has credit.

I turned to this sub 18 mos ago when I needed to clean up my finances due to emotional issues (years of debilitating and unmedicated depression). I learned how to and thank everyone who helped. 

I’m now “stuck” with the parent’s 2004 condo — it’s value is still under water, located in a MCOL low value area of a very desirable, HCOL state.

I already have 1 rental property that pays for itself. I have learned how be a good LL over the years and can handle repairs. However, it would not be convenient.

Should I buy a condo that will become a rental property at 23?,"  

I’m 23 and make 78k a year. I’m fortunate to live with my family and my credit card bill is about $1000/month on average. The only expense I have to pay is my car insurance at 180/month.. the rest goes towards things like food, clothes, going out, vacation etc. I know I should probably spend less per month and I’m working towards that. I bought a brand new car when I started my job that I paid off in 4 months and now I am debt-free.

I currently have 25k saved up, 10k of which I’ve recently put in a high interest savings account. I will be adding more to that account.  I put 10% of each pay cheque into my 401k (this is not part of the 25k I mentioned being saved). 

I’m considering buying property in Ann Arbor, Michigan. I would want to buy a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo for \~150k and rent out the other room for 700-800/month plus utilities. I would get something that’s in the 5-10 mile range of the University of Michigan, so I would think that there should be a demand because of the students. 

I’m also open to the option of getting a 1 bedroom/1 bathroom for the price range of 100-120k and just living there myself. 

If I was to buy property, then I think I would stay there for 2-5 years. 

Here are some concerns: I’m a Canadian citizen living in the US on a TN visa. I don’t know where I will eventually “settle down”. Maybe I’ll stay in Michigan, or maybe I’ll move back to Canada or maybe I might go somewhere else completely.

I’m also not sure what my credit score is, since I’ve only been in the country for 10 months. I’m looking to get another credit card though and if I do decide to buy it won’t be until several months.

I would get a property manager to handle the place when I move out.  I think by age 30 I would want to be married and own a family home that I would buy in joint with my future spouse. 

I’m considering buying a place because I don’t want to live with my parents forever, and it seems like it would be better to buy instead of rent. However, I’m worried that buying could be a headache and not a wise financial decision.

I would think that property prices shouldn’t drop in Ann Arbor, since it’s not just dependent on the automotive industry like a lot of Michigan, but I haven’t done too much research on that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/convcw/should_i_buy_a_condo_that_will_become_a_rental/,1565472258,personalfinance

Is doing a “cash-in” refinance with today’s rates crazy?,"My wife and I currently have a hefty $3,600/month mortgage in Seattle. We had always been able to pay it OK, but we recently had 2 kids and the childcare costs are tough. Our non-retirement savings are significant ($170k in index funds), but our monthly budget is now falling into the red, and I don’t like it.

I’m planning to refinance the house to lower our rate from 4.125% to 3.5%. This is a no-brainer, and will bring our payment down to $3,300/month. Would it also be smart to “spend” some savings to lower our mortgage principal further? E.g., if I spent $70k of savings, that would lower the payment to $2950/month. If I spent $120k it would go down to $2,675/month.

On the one hand, I like the idea of *permanently* lowering my mortgage. But on the other hand, 3.5% is such low interest, maybe the money is better kept in the market.

Options as I see them:

* Keep the cash invested as-is, don’t spend any on lowering the mortgage.

"Hoping to get a new credit card, how are my chances?","Particularly I’m dying Apple Card, for when I get an invite. I realize it’s not every bodies cup of tea, but there are multiple reasons why I like the idea of this card, aside from the “flex” factor. But I’m concerned about getting approved, due to not having the best luck with my credit history. 


I’m 27 and never had a major loan, and only have 1 credit card from my bank from almost 3 years ago. Its a secured card, but the deposit was refunded a while ago, so its now unsecured. It’s got a $500 limit that they won’t increase to save my life. Never paid a penny of interest and never been late, not even once. I pay it off way before due. 

My FICO is at 597. My score was like 650 for a while, until recently a medical bill dropped it to 597. I make like 30k. No loans of any kind, car, home, etc. Credit Karma says my scores are like 656TU/671EQ. According to CK my biggest issues are credit history (2 years and 7 months) and my derogatory marks (little over $2k or medical bills.) but also apparently only having 1 account is negatively affecting me, as well.

I know my details aren’t the best, but I am financially responsible. I just need to get a bank to take a chance. And definitely hoping this Apple Card works out!

A question about Social Security Income (18Yr Old),"So I'm currently 18 about to enter college. Long story short. About a month after I turned 17, both my parents died in car accident. So I recieved my dads Social Security up until graduation from high school. PS I graduated two months ago.

Thing is, I never got counseling or any sort of help for my mental health. My parents death definitely screwed me up mentally. There is some things that make severely depressed so I try to stay away from them. This happened a lot my senior year. It started to affect me during school a lot but I had nobody to talk to so it was rather difficult. It still affects me quite a lot. I can't stay alone or else I get very depressed. Random Panic attacks too, something I never got prior to my parents death. I get these depression periods twice a month and they suck indefinitely. 

Somebody I talked to at work told me I might be eligible for social security disability? What do you guys think? Maybe these issues will go away overtime?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coo9te/a_question_about_social_security_income_18yr_old/,1565474252,personalfinance

When asked for salary expectations Do Not Give A Number,"I've seen this time and time again on this sub and with my friends IRL. 

My friend recently interviewed at a job and they asked ""What are your salary expectations?"" To which he replied ""I'm looking in the realm of $50-$60k"". Guess what they offered him?

Ding. You guessed it. 50k. 

When asked this question in an interview, do not give a number instead reply with something along the lines of...

Interviewer: ""Now, What would you say your salary expectations are?""
You: ""I would just expect to be paid fairly for the experience and skills that I bring to the table"" 

If they press further - tell them ""I would be remiss to give a number because there are many aspects that go into overall compensation and I would need to be able to compare all aspects of it.""

This is a completely true statement as Bonus, Stock, Health Insurance, 401k, HSA, PTO and Education Reimbursement are all elements of a potential compensation plan.


EDIT: I realize that there isn't a one size fits all approach to this. If you know exactly what you are worth and have confidence in that number, all the power to you to give an accurate and informed number to HR. It is in your best interest to try to negotiate up as much as you can, and many HR reps will try to get good talent for low cost to the company. It definitely is a negotiation. I would argue that the majority of people do not know exactly what their range is, and yes research is key here, but doesn't always lead to the employee being confident in a number they should be getting paid. I think many people do do themselves a disservice by undervaluing their talent and come in low. That could be due to lack of research, lack of confidence, lack of negotiation skills etc. One way to combat this for people that are newer to interviewing and don't have a good sense of were they fall on that spectrum, is to try to abstain from giving a number. That's all my point was about.

EDIT 2: I regret making this as an ultimatum. Went for effect and definitely got it. This doesn't apply to everyone. There are situations that giving a number is advisable. Also getting a lot of comments on online applications, and from HR or hiring managers railing against this idea. I appreciate all of the responses, difference in opinion, even the rude ones.

Vanguard Tradtional Index Funds (TIFs) vs. Exchange-Trade Funds (ETFs). Which to use?,"For nearly every Vanguard TIF there seems to be an equivalent ETF version. They appear to be invested in the exact same funds (presumably yielding the same returns) but with a lower expense ratio.

For instance, the traditional Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund [VTSAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTSAX) has an expense ratio of .04% with a minimum investment amount of $3000. While the ETS version, [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/overview/vti) has an expense ratio of .03% and no minimum investment required.

From my basic understanding, an ETS gives you the option to buy and sell the index fund in real-time. But if I plan on buying and holding for 10+ years with the intent of capitalizing on long-term market returns, wouldn't it be better to use the ETS version simply because there is a lower expense ratio? Plus this way I wouldn't have to wait to accumulate the minimum $3000 and could start putting that money to work immediately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coodin/vanguard_tradtional_index_funds_tifs_vs/,1565474759,personalfinance

"Parents are kicking me and my wife out. Options? Ypsilanti, MI","Not gonna go into context because it isn’t relevant and would make this post way too long.

I’m in college on a full-ride scholarship with a driver’s license and no savings of any sort.  Recently fired from my job for calling off because I was in the ER.

Wife is going to be going to college this next semester on a Pell grant, currently working on her license, no savings of any sort either.  Fired from the same place at the same time for the same reason (although she had nothing to do with me calling off).

We’re both going into IT and our college provides resources for students seeking work, so we’re not concerned about finding work being an impossible task.  For either of us, the average pay at any job we could get through our college right now is 13/hr at 30hr/wk.  So ~1300/mo after taxes for either of us.

As the title says, parents are kicking us out once we have jobs.  They are suggesting that we find low-income housing or apartments or a trailer.  We live near Ypsilanti/Ann Arbor and the rent there ranges from 800 to 2000+ so we’re probably going to end up in low income housing or a trailer park, and I’m concerned about crime and whatnot.  I don’t know what to do to secure our place or our belongings or car or anything. 

As we live in Michigan and are young, car insurance rates are through the roof.  To insure both me and my wife on a 2000ish Jeep Wrangler that we were looking at, it would be about $500 a month according to Liberty Mutual.  And that was one of the cheapest to insure cars I got a quote on from them.  Everything we need is pretty close so gas mileage isn’t a killer.  Parents think that we should just take the bus everywhere, but I’m not a fan of being stuck in the city and unable to go where the buses don’t.  I don’t know what to do on this front.

To put it lightly the relationship between my parents and I is... strained.  Not totally interested in interacting with them anymore after this.  A while ago they fronted me about $2000 for financing on a few things that I couldn’t finance due to having no credit score.  The items are in their name and they’re paying on them but we verbally agreed that I would pay them back once I could.  If I left the items in question with my parents when moving out, could they come after me for the money?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coogjp/parents_are_kicking_me_and_my_wife_out_options/,1565475185,personalfinance
Parents keep flipping between kicking me out and not. What can I do?,"My family and I have a long, weird, and complicated history containing mental illness (mostly from mother) and daily fights. The worst including having baseball bats being thrown at me, charged at with a knife, ""I wish you would have never been born"", and ""I wish I could've aborted you.""

My family is between upper-middle class and lower-upper class and my parents paid for what my student loans didn't cover, leaving me with $28k debt which is fair. However, I did keep asking them not to pay for a single dime because I knew they would hold it over my head and I was exactly right even though they kept promising they wouldn't.

I took a year off after high school and worked at Walmart during that time in order to save up some money as well as take some classes at my community college. After that year I went to college and two weeks ago finished the last 6 credits I needed for my Bachelor's with summer classes. During those college years I worked part-time during school and full-time during breaks. The job I had usually worked screwed me over this summer ""break"" and kept scheduling me during my summer classes so I had to quit. Literally the second day after finishing my classes we had a huge blowout about how they think I have no desire in finding a job even though I constantly offer to show them all of my pending applications (logic has very little presence in my family). Every time I try to look for a job out and about or go to an interview they scream at me about using ""their car"" and ""their gas"" to find these things and how ""I probably didn't even go to the interview"" even though they could just call the places and ask. I used to have a truck but we had to sell it during tough financial times.

So now my life consists of woken up by my parents running downstairs in the morning to yell at me about how lazy and shitty I am, looking at jobs online, eating nothing but the little food I buy for myself unless my mom guilt trips me into eating her food because ""I don't love her if I don't"", talking to my girlfriend, working out, and sleeping. I don't play video games anymore because I've grown tired of them all and I've never really had real-life friends ever since a lot of bad experiences happened when I used to have friends over. I also don't spend my money on anything but food. When I ask how I'm being a ""leech"" or a ""freeloader"", they just point to how they pay for the electricity, water, and insurance for me and how they give me free rent (I used to offer to pay for my ""rent"" but it ended with them just refusing it because I was being ""silly"") and how ""all these things add up"".

All of my friends and girlfriend tell me that the way they talk to me and treat me from what they can sometimes overhear shows them to be very narcissistic and controlling. I constantly reflect on the arguments I have with them after the fact asking myself if I'm the one that's actually in the wrong but I have yet to see how they could possibly be in the right.

So I'm asking what I should do in my uncertain situation. I live in eastern Kansas, have $800, never had a credit card, apparently have a credit score of around 690 according to Credit Karma, have a Bachelor's degree, no car, and no debt other than the student loans that kick in in six months. All of this might change on a whim and they decide to completely flip all of that the next day but I'm trying to come up with a worst-case scenario plan as I'm quite lost at the moment.

TL;DR Family is weird, graduated, what do?

EDIT: From the comments: I have usajobs.gov, LinkedIn, Indeed, Monster, and Geebo accounts as well as email alerts for jobs in my field from Google. I have an offer from the DHS in the state of Washington but I obviously can't move there right now. I have plenty of options for finding lower wage ""teenager"" jobs but I have no way of getting to them if my parents decide to take away my using the car privileges again. As well as the fact that they were still this bad about kicking me out while I was working full-time at Walmart and going to school part-time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/coohax/parents_keep_flipping_between_kicking_me_out_and/,1565475299,personalfinance

I already have a well-paid job ($95k), but the city I live in is crazy expensive and if I ever want to buy a house in this area, I need to be able to put aside more than the $500/month that I can to my long term cash savings fund. (Different than short term savings or my 401k — savings just for big things down the line).

I’ve literally never had to put thought into my taxes before; I’m single, no kids, work and live in the same city, and don’t have any deductions ever except for charitable giving. I want to make sure that I’m thinking ahead on this so I don’t get a nasty surprise on April 15. Specific things I’m concerned about:

- Withholding &amp; tax payments. Most online resources I’ve found are aimed at people who freelance/gig full time, have a lower base salary, or are retired. I realize that making this much and still needing a side gig is rare, so I’d love advice on how to correctly estimate how much I need to be earmarking for taxes. (If it helps, I expect that this will be bringing in about $600/month.)

- Can anyone suggest an app for tracking mileage and expenses for deductions? I’m fine hand-calculating Uber miles off my trip odometer and logging them vs. using an app like MileageIQ that tracks for you. My car is totally paid off if that makes a difference. 

- Is there anything I’m not thinking about, tax-wise? I’ve done my research otherwise on driving for Uber/Lyft and think it’s still a good idea despite the downsides I’ve read about.

ROTH IRA initial investment decreased by almost 40% in about a year - Help?,"Hello followers of personal finance, 

I  have never posted here before, but I am quite at a loss as to what to do. I've always been a thrifty future focused individual and I wanted to start saving for retirement. So, last spring, I opened a ROTH IRA with the help of an investor that my parents use.

He uses Fidelity. I invested the maximum contribution at the time of 5.5k. My investor chose which companies/stocks to invest in. He chose GALT, MINT, OMER, &amp; THERF. I noticed a substantial drop off right after the account opened but wasn't too worried since my investor warned me and said that this was normal. I didn't worry much until January when I noticed my account had dropped down to about 3.5k - two thousand less than I initially invested. 

I asked my investor if this is normal in January and he said it is unusual. This is the exact reply he gave me: 

*""No, that is unusual. Most of the time the market is moving higher rather than lower. Unfortunately, the market has been having one of its nastier spells recently and you happened to invest just before that happened. Furthermore, since you have a very, very long term perspective, I invested you in some small growth stocks which tend to be the most volatile when the market hits a bad patch. The good news, is they are also the most volatile when the market recovers and we have seen just so far this week where your portfolio is up about 8% or so already. So, you just had a bit of bad luck on when you got started investing but that may already have started to turn. The companies we invested you in have not had some terrible thing happen to them – they are still on track with their businesses. It is just the market freaked out pretty soon after you started your portfolio. And the market will do that from time to time – usually once every 5 years or so, but it can be more often. Since this money is for your retirement, you are not going to be touching it for quite a long time and you will no doubt experience quite a few periods of such market turmoil over the years. But, if history proves to be an accurate guide and you don’t panic when everyone else is, you will have quite a tidy sum of money when you reach 59 ½.*

*Over history, and I am just estimating this but it is going to be generally right, the market rises on about 52% of the average days, 56% of the average weeks, 62% of the average months, 70% of the average quarters, 75% of the average 1 years, 90% of the average 5 year periods and almost 100% of the average ten year time periods. So, things should work out fine for you in the long run and your early investing experience is just a reflection of unfortunate timing.""*

It is now August and the account value is still dropping. The drops are less dramatic but I am just barely above 3k. I don't know if I should just wait it out like my investor suggested or if I should take things into my own hands and invest elsewhere. 

I am worried about this because I have saved up another 6k and want to invest more for my retirement but am scared to continue investing with my current investor's plan if it means I will lose thousands more of my money. I'm still in college so I don't have much money to spare currently and would rather play it safe long term. 

1. Did my investor just choose poor/risky stock to invest in?
2. Should I change what I'm investing in?
3. Should I invest more money in the IRA? 
4. Will things be okay in the end/balance out with all the time I'm giving the investments before taking anything out?

Any help or advice would be so appreciated. I need a second opinion.

My CA state tax got returned to me,"Tl;dr: CA state tax return didn’t get filed; I am owed 800$. 


I filed my CA state taxes before the deadline this year, and moved apartments shortly after. 

As it turns out, the tax return got sent back to my old address and didn’t get mail forwarded. I just found out from the tenant that lives at my old address. 

I don’t owe any money. I should be getting a refund of about 800$.

Pay off Debt or Invest More?,So I make about 30k a year and I do a good job saving more than half my paycheck.

First Time House Purchase by borrowing from 401K- Feedback Please,"Throwaway account for now.

Hi All. I truly hope you'll read this to the end and forgive me for a very long post. This likely will be the only such post I would do.

* M/43/Employed/US, married, spouse on permanent disability
* Last 4+ years with the same employer. May not be laid off in the near future.
* Gross is about $106,000. She gets about 13,000 from SSA. She also has about 7K in store card debts. I don't count her disability assistance for budgeting.
* have about  182,230.22 in 401K as of this writing (already maxed out this year by May, maxed out last year as well)
* 401K website shows 12.52% return since inception (10/31/2015-07/31/2019)
* 401K has a blend of Roth and Pretax and some company contributions in which I'm not fully vested (requires 5+ years of employment)
* No car loan, credit cards that have about 2.5% utilization, gets paid off every month. 
* no major hobbies that cost $$$, I enjoy being frugal(not cheap, lol), shop in Goodwill, Value Village.
* Renting until this month (approximately $1900 including utilities, after about $110 annual increase this June)
* What I have :
   * About  $**60,584.02** split across - Cash ( 13,697.11  ) Roth IRA ( 37,244.63), Traditional IRA( $9,541.31 ). The rest in a standard brokerage account (all in Schwab).
   * About 4500 in a Credit Union savings account, the money I earned for driving for Uber, Lyft etc part-time a few years ago.
   * About $17,600 worth of my employer's stock purchased via Employee Stock Purchase Plan; I stopped contributing to this, since they offer no online access. 
   * I didn't have more on hand, because I paid my Dad's huge medical bills during his final days, plus paid off some of wife's debt.
* The stocks are nothing too risky, mostly Schwab and Vanguard ETFs linked to S&amp;P 500 and large cap ETFs etc. The stocks were all purchased a few years ago, when ShareBuilder used to give free trade credits for birthdays or special promos and some free trade credits I got from Schwab for bringing in my holdings from other brokerages.
* What I did after getting tired of apartment living:
   * Attended 3 home buying classes sponsored by our state, each with a different combo of {RE+Mortgage Rep}. One was enough, but I used this to evaluate a few mortgage companies, RE agents etc. I found one set that I'm quite happy with.
   * Saw several houses a month ago one Saturday with the RE agent, picked one I liked and started the process. It was quick, because the house was good and I didn't see the point in prolonging it. It cost $420,000 and no HOA. The appraisal was done two days ago, which added equity instantly.
   * I asked my apartment leasing company to switch me to month to month, which caused this month's rent to be \~$2450.
   * &amp;#x200B;
   * **This is where I need the advice/tips/thoughts from people better than I in this** \-Since I my PMI was going to be about $70 or $80 per month, I was OK with not doing 20% towards the down payment ( I don't have that much in cash). So instead of selling my stock holdings and get hit with capital gains, I decided to borrow 45K from my 401K plan @ 6.5% interest for a 15 year period which comes to about $180 per paycheck.  This I do not intend to keep it open that long, and I understand the constraints in borrowing from 401K.  I ~~hated~~ dislike to do this, but I disliked the idea of paying capital gains tax even more. I intend to add some of the cash on hand towards the down payment in addition to the borrowed amount. 
   * Please share your thoughts if I can do anything better. Should I sell my holdings (non IRA) and take capital gains hit and pay down the 401K loan? Should I do some kind of hardship withdrawal from the IRAs? What am I doing right and what am I doing wrong?  Should I continue contributing to the 401K, next year or focus on paying down the loan? 

Reading this forum gave me the confidence to go ahead with house purchase. Any constructive criticism is appreciated. **Thank you.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/copkmx/first_time_house_purchase_by_borrowing_from_401k/,1565481002,personalfinance
"I ordered a $13,000+ bank check from Discover to put a down payment on a car. I then cancelled that check and the funds have not been put back into my account. What do I do?","I recently purchased a car from a dealership over 200 miles away from my house. To pay for the car, I agreed to put down approximately $13,000 of my own money and finance approximately $12,000. I didn't know that the dealership took personal checks, so I ordered a bank check from Discover for the amount of the down payment. Immediately after ordering the check - and I mean literally 7 mins later - I get a call from the dealership informing me that they take personal checks. In order to expedite the process, I decide that writing a personal check is, in fact, the better option. I call Discover and ask first, if they'll cancel the bank check that I ordered - again, this is literally 7 minutes later - and second, if the check is cancelled, will the funds be deposited back into my account in a timely fashion. I'm told, unequivocally, that the check can be cancelled and that the funds would be deposited back into my account by the end of the business day, which was this past Thursday, 8/8. Based on this information, I write the personal check and overnight it, and the loan check, to the dealership. Friday morning, I check my account and the funds have not been deposited back yet. This is concerning. I don't have an additional $13,000+ in my account. The personal check I wrote will bounce, potentially after the car has already been shipped to me. I call Discover. I'm told by a second woman that the check was certainly cancelled and that the funds would be back in my account by the end of the business day, 8/9. Today, as I'm going to deposit my pay check, I notice that my account balance is still low. It's the weekend. Even if the dealership got the check, there's no way it would be cashed and the funds taken from my account yet. This means that once again, the funds weren't put back into my account. I called again today and was told that because it's the weekend, there's no way to find out why the funds aren't in my account, but I was once again assured that the request to cancel the check was processed. 

What do I do at this point? I neglected to get anyone's name or information, even on Friday. I'm not sure if that would have helped, but it couldn't hurt. I'm going to call back Monday, but the dealership received the envelope with my check. If they cash it, it will bounce. Obviously if that happens, the dealership is (rightfully so) going to pursue me for it. Is there anything I can do outside of what I've already done?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/copl56/i_ordered_a_13000_bank_check_from_discover_to_put/,1565481078,personalfinance
I have horrible credit and need a new-to-me car.,"My current vehicle has been giving me issues for the past several years, all of which I have either repaired myself or had repaired by a mechanic if the job was out of my wheelhouse. Also, somebody keyed the word “BITCH” on the hood and keyed scratches on all the other sides. But now it is starting to have transmission problems. Replacing the transmission will cost more than the car is worth at this point. So I’m in the market for another vehicle. I have a credit score of &lt;500 due to defaulting on student loans, a credit card, and medical bills. I know, shame on me. I’m working on rehabilitating my student loans (which should come out of default after 10 consecutive payments) and rebuilding my credit as best I can right now. I’m going to get a secured credit card and use it only for gas at work, which I will be reimbursed for by my employer. Therefore, I can steadily pay off the debt on that card.

But back to the vehicle situation...

I plan on getting a vehicle that is going to be dependable. I understand that vehicles do need maintenance work done, but I’m so tired of frequent maintenance and repairs. So I’m looking for a vehicle that is ~5 years old or newer, and has been well taken care of by the previous owner(s). And I will drive it until the wheels fall off, much like I have done with my current vehicle. Most vehicles that I have found that meet my expectations are $12k+. I only have ~$6k to my name and with such a low credit score I’m sure monthly payments will be through the roof for financing the vehicle purchase. My monthly income fluctuates in the range of 1400-2400, but on average I would say it’s about 2000. My monthly expenses are about 1000. As of now, my vehicle is still getting me to work and back, but I don’t know when it will completely crap on me. I just know I need to get rid of the Bitch-mobile before it’s too late.

I don’t even really know what particular advice I’m asking for. I’m just starting to stress out about what to do. Any thoughts, advice, smart ass comments to lift me up a little... it will all be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/copm88/i_have_horrible_credit_and_need_a_newtome_car/,1565481231,personalfinance

1- I am thinking about joining a freelance work website and it needs me to present W9 information.What does that mean ? Where do I obtain W9 information ? Do I send a form to IRS via mail ?

2- How do we communicate with IRS ?  I know that after 183 days in the US, I am supposed to pay taxes. But I have zero income. So how do I check my situation ? Where do we register and control what I owe ? How do we start the relationship?

helping parents plan for retirement,"parents helped me a lot and now i have a good job with some money I wanna give them. They dont need money right now so i think putting it in a retirement account is best due to tax benefits

parents are immigrants and older (59 and 57). own house ~200-250k. own 2 1-2 year old cars, one paid off the other 0% interest. They both put into 401k up to match but have done so recently and have pretty crap matches. plan to live off social security/work part time. maybe 100k in 401ks combined but idk for sure

Want to give them ~5k/year

1) thinking best way is to open up a traditional ira in the name of the older one (so they can withrdaw faster if needed) of their names (with permission) and put that in there. This way they can get money in their retirement account and get more tax refund each year. 

Am I missing anything?

2) if I open a tIRA how to pick asset allocation. I use scwab and buy etfs for my ira so id prod do the same. At first i was just thinking pick a target date fund but then i thought of a potential issue; if in the future the stocks are down and my parents want to pull from the fund i would have to sell etfs as whole and so i would lose money due to selling low. but if i bought bond etfs and stock etfs (schb), in a time when stocks are doing poorly i could sell the bonds. 

i dont know much about bonds vs bond etfs. bonds cannot lose principal but need to mature before cashing in yes? do bond etfs have that pro without the con (sell whenever, wont lose principal)

Negotiating higher pay when absorbing additional responsibilities at work,"Hello,

I work as an engineer and have been with the same company for almost 5 years now. In that time I have gotten two raises, 3% each. We have a large, multi-year contract that was recently finalized. Normally we hire on additional staff as needed for these contracts and one of them being a scheduler. I've been taking scheduling courses so that I could start taking on additional responsibilities in the company and for this project I am going to be taking over the scheduling duties so we won't need to hire for this position.

For the project I will be retaining the same responsibilities I had previously and also all the scheduler's responsibilities. I have no problem with that and am excited in fact. We also talked about pay adjustment as a discussion we will have soon. I am unsure what to expect them to offer, but also want to make sure I've done my due diligence to manage expectations and come to the discussion prepared.

Now this opportunity seems like a win/win where my employer will not need to pay an additional person wages and benefits and I get a pay raise and set myself up for moving up in the company in the future. Right now I'm hoping for at least a 20% raise. Right now I get paid hourly and during these jobs I get a considerable amount of overtime. There may also be a possibility of moving to a day rate, which could actually lower my pay if the raise isn't enough to match the amount of overtime so this may also be another point of negotiation.

Has anyone had a similar experience in the past and how did it work out? Is 20% a realistic number?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ckwqkv/negotiating_higher_pay_when_absorbing_additional/,1564705469,personalfinance

Wells Fargo Pending Deposit,"I cashed a small check ~300$ today at 1:30pm at a wells fargo atm. The cutoff time for this particular atm is 9pm.

Where should I put cash for ~7 months that will be used to pay taxes next year?,"I am going to owe money to the IRS for tax year 2019 and currently have about what I'll need in cash in my bank account.  What's the best place to put this money for the next ~7 months so it's not just losing to inflation?  

So far the options are:

High yield savings account like from Wealthfront Cash Account (2.57% APY) or whatever else if there's a reason not to use Wealthfront.  


Bond ETFs like BLV or BND


VTI (Vanguard Total Stock Index) which is my main long-term investment



I can always sell some of my existing VTI, so it's not like it's the end of the world if the value drops.  I'm just looking for the theoretical maximum gain.  The only concern I have is if there will be any negative tax consequences if I have to sell some of my VTI.  I will be in a lower tax bracket next year if that changes anything.

They had a college graduate program that put $500, on them, for a down payment on a lease, or on a financed new car. When we asked them about this program, they told me to simply bring in my diploma, and they'll throw on an extra $500 for free on the lease down payment.

Here's the thing: even though I recently graduated with an undergraduate degree, I'm starting medical school in the fall. Not once did I tell them anything other than the truth about this. I told them that my entire income (over $50k per year) was through grants, scholarships, student loans, and my savings from working through undergrad, and I had them run my credit score, and was apparently approved. I put money down, I showed them my diploma, they added on the $500 to the down payment for the lease, we finished all of the paperwork, they handed me the keys, and I drove home with it.

Just now I got a phone call from them, in a panic, telling me that they ""didn't know I was still a student"", that the graduate $500 down program was ""only if you graduated and ALREADY have a job offer"" and that I would need to put more money down, and get someone to cosign for me on the lease agreement. They never disclosed this information to me.

Here's the thing that I'm confused about: I have a signed lease agreement between me, and an authorized signature by their ""finance manager"". I have the paperwork, signed by them, stating that I was approved for the amount given. I've already paid for the down payment, the car is under my insurance that I have already paid for, and I honestly do not have anyone else to help me co-sign on this car.

Do I legally have to refinance and get a cosigner? Do I need to give them more money if I already have paperwork signed by them? I feel like if they can't lease to someone who's income is primarily from grants, scholarships, student loans, and a savings account, then they should have told me that immediately when we started talking about numbers; not a week after the deal is said-and-done. I feel like they made a mistake, and they want me to pay for it. Can anyone help me with what I need to do next?

UPDATE 1: We went into the dealership just now and spoke to the finance manager that approved of the lease agreement, and signed it, in the first place. He said, and I quote, ""the lease was approved but the bank WANTS you to have someone to cosign it"" and that if I can't have someone do that for me that they will ""probably take the car, or something like that."" He kept saying over and over again that my student loans, grants, and scholarships don't count as income. He also agreed that he *knew* where my income came from, and still approved it anyways. I've spoken to my bank about this and they said that as soon as the loans are in my account, it's my money to do with and is technically income. 25k a year of my income I don't even have to pay back, it's just grants and scholarships. It sounds to me like he (the finance manager there) made a mistake, got chewed out by his boss, and is trying to intimidate me into cancelling the lease (there is a 30-day grace period where I can cancel it and get my money back), and restart with someone else to cosign.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ckwuyi/i_signed_a_lease_for_a_new_car_but_now_theyre/,1564706153,personalfinance

"Final year of medical school. Financially challanged. Stressed about crazy debt, graduation, the future","I am a fourth-year med student at a good medical school here in the US. I get decent grades, but am worried about graduating as there are a couple of make or break tests between now and graduation (I think worst case scenarios all the time).

Basically, I hate having this debt over my head with so long before I could start to pay it off. I worry about not graduating, not matching, not paying back my loans. 

I am thinking about joining the military for the sole purpose of paying off my loans, but this is a big commitment (I would be trading one ball-and-chain for another).

What’s the scam here?,"I notice lots of scams posted on PF and I have heard of many of them. This is new to me and I was wondering what the scam is. 

A friend of mine recently received a package of expensive wheels and tires at his house. Of course he did not order them but they were delivered to him at his address. He opened the box, found the  random wheels and tires and an invoice made out to him with a random phone number. He googled the phone number and it came back as a number used previously in fraud. No details, but just that it was potential fraud. 

He called the company (legit) that shipped them and they are looking into it and flagged the purchase. He checked his credit cards, no suspicious activity. He froze his credit out of precaution. 

So what exactly is going on in this situation? Why would someone order thousands of dollars in wheels and ship them to him? I am assuming they wanted to get the package before he got home?

How much do you value commute when negotiating a job offer?,"Hello!

I recently received a job offer that would bump my current income up by 3-7k (based on performance bonuses).

With that said, my commute would go from a quick 18 minute, 7 mile commute primarily on a major (but never congested) route to a 52 minute, 27.5 mile commute primarily across windy/hilly rural back roads.

My daily commute would involve driving for an additional hour and additional 40 miles of gas/wear every day. Not to mention my concerns about said rural roads in the winter..

There is an alternate route in the event of winter, but its an expressway that is pure hell to commute on even on the best of days. Rush hour is always bumper to bumper &amp; goes right through the heart of downtown. In addition it would be an extra 10 miles in each direction &amp; would take 10-30 minutes longer on even the best of days. There seems to be an accident on this road during rush hour that backs everything up further at least once a week too.

&amp;#x200B;

I was just hoping to possibly get some input from you all on what you value your commutes at when negotiating an offer. Possibly some commute stories, some general discussion about how commutes relate to personal finance, or even just a random joke associated with either commutes or personal finance ;)

Should I feel satisfied with my new salary?,"Hey guys,

So I don’t know why I feel this way, but I can’t help regretting my negotiation of salary even though it was a considerable bump. Looking for feedback and advice on how to feel happy with a new salary in a new job.

I just started my second job after college, after 5 years at my previous employer. I started out at $50k after college (Chicago), and was up to $88k+$5k bonus when I left. I’m 27yo. My new job initially offered $110k+15% bonus (which I was happy with at the time) and I countered at $115k just to see if I could move the needle.

I did not update my card details. But a couple of weeks after that, I got a $59.99 charge on my new card from Frontier. When I log into my account, it still doesn't say I'm a member. I can't access anywhere that says cancel/unsubscribe because under my profile it still just says (paraphrasing), ""sign up for discount den!"". 

Are they allowed to charge my new card? How did they get the information? Will it affect my ability to fly Frontier if I dispute the charges?

Wealth Preservation Strategy,"Hello all!

A family friend of mine has asked that I assist her in straightening out her finances and preparing for retirement. Being that I'm still very much a novice, I'd like to hear this threads opinion on the situation. 

She's currently 3 years out from retirement. House, car and all other major expenses are paid for. For years, she's been churning several hundred thousand dollars in CDs that offer 1.75 to 2% (surprised to see such low rates considering the balances). She's cautious of entering the market. At this point, would it be more sensible to keep churning, transfer to high yield savings acct or find a low cost/ low risk fund?

A friend of hers has recommended that she look into annuities. I've advised against that, having heard about how financial advisor's recommendations are self-serving.

Also, she has a decently sized 401k with Principal Funds. It's currently assigned to a balanced portfolio called SAM. Her return is avg 12% but the expense ratio is quite high. My thought would be for her to roll that into a more economic fund with vanguard, but I'm unsure if it's worth doing and the costs associated. 

Any direction and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Medical Bills (2K) that I flat out can’t pay.,"Hello all, I’m a 22 year old father, sole income for my fiancé and our son. I don’t have insurance, haven’t had it since I turned 18. I had to see a urologist roughly 4 years ago, and now I’ve got about 2K in medical bills that I can’t afford, and a credit agency is hounding me to pay it. I can’t. I can’t even make payments on it. We live in a garage that’s been converted into an apartment and I drive a car worth 1 grand. How should I approach this? Paying the debt isn’t an option, I’m already skipping meals to save money.

I do have family I trust here in the States who could wire me money, and it *looks* like WesternUnion doesn't charge a fee when sending to a bank account, although what they claim the current exchange rate is, is incorrect.

Is this medical bill settlement fair?,"Okay so long version is in November of last year my daughter fell and cut open her head. It was really deep and as a concerned parent I ended up taking her to the emergency room. At the time I had not been at my employer long enough to qualify for health insurance coverage but also made too much to qualify for government insurance. (I had called me state as well as the health and human services and was told basically to ride it out.)

So I goto the er and they submit my application for public health insurance and I get denied. So at this point I get a bill maybe 3 months later for $1,600 from the dr who actually did the stitches. I called and explained my situation and I offered to do payments but they told basically said to me me pay in full or goto collections. At the time I said if that’s what you wanna do so be it.

Yesterday I got a bill and checked my credit but it looks like my debt was turned over to the collection agency but the agency is going to give me 30 days to pay it or else it goes onto my credit. I used the advice on here and managed to talk them down to 1200, then 1000, 900, to 840.41. I said would that settle everything and they said yes. I asked for a paper saying as such but they said they couldn’t give one but once it was paid it would be settled. So my question is 1. Is this normal and if I paid the 840.41 I would be all set? And 2. Is that amount a fair compromise? I have the money and it wouldn’t put me in a bad spot financially, but was wanting someone else’s assurance or advice.

Personal Debt Consolidation Loan or Snowball?,"Long story short of it all is that I've accumulated $29K in debt from the past four years from things ranging from moving on my own and fully furnishing my house to trips I've off-loaded to credit cards.

I currently utilize four cards, three of which are VISA's, and another that is a charge card.  My debt for the cards and APRs are as follows:

| Card   | Debt    | APR     |
|:-----------|------------:|:------------:|
| VISA 1        |          $13,500|     16.15%     
| VISA 2  |    $9,900|  22.24%   
| VISA 3       |        $3,800|   20.49%     
| Charge       |        $1000~|   -  

The past four months I've been paying back around $1000 on the charge card due to personal emergency travel.  Paying that much each month gave me a wake up call to really finish off this shit and seriously take on getting out of debt.

Looking into it from a search on this subreddit (and this subreddit wiki's advice) I see it's highly suggested to just do snowballing for debt, however, with my APR%'s, would it be worthwhile to get a personal loan for debt consolidation?  My credit score is 680~ (fair), and if approved I can get a loan for around 14.99% APR (or worse, they use average and it becomes 18.99%).

Some other background information about me, I firmly believe I have discipline on not using the cards if I pursue the loan (I haven't touched two of the cards since April).  Honestly speaking, I would ""lock away"" three of the cards and keep the charge card (just to gain points).

My monthly paycheck is around $2,800~, of which I already budged/alloted out my rent, bills, utilites and an extra $700 I use to just throw at the current monthly payments I owe.  I do set aside money for my 401K (6%~ of my monthly pay) and, previously, had a $200 allotment set aside for investing.

Seeing the above, I clearly can budget much more on myself but for simlicity, and to just ease it, would the loan be worth it or should I just budget harder and stop doing minimal payments?  (To note, I know that minimal payments on debt is just stop gap/trap, that's why I want some outside advice to either snowball or consolidate for my situation.)

Thank you for your time.

Credit card questions,"First, my current situation: I currently have two credit cards. My primary card is an Amazon Prime Visa card that I use for basically all purchases. Chase has raised my credit limit multiple times without me really doing anything, and it now sits at $12,800. I pay the statement balance off in full each month, so it carries no debt, but the current balance sometimes reaches as high as $4,000 or so. I also have a Wells Fargo platinum card that is much older (opened in 2009, I believe); I got it before I had a real job, so the credit limit is only $600 dollars. I don't use this card at all because of the low credit limit and not as good rewards.  Wells Fargo has occasionally asked me for my income (high five figures), ostensibly to see if I qualify for a credit limit increase, but has never actually increased my limit.

So, my questions:

1) Is Wells Fargo not increasing my credit limit because I'm not using the card? Will using it make them more likely to increase the limit?

2) Would it make sense for me to apply for a third credit card in order to decrease my overall credit utilization? I don't think I'll really use multiple cards, because I don't want the trouble of figuring out which one to use in which situation. I also don't travel enough to make use of travel rewards, and I like the rewards I get from the Amazon card.

Financing auto loan fell through and I would like some advice,"Hi guys.

This is in GA.

I'm in the early 20s and I have no credit score. I have never had a credit card of my own.

I will try my best to keep this short.

5/28 - I signed the contract for a new Honda Civic. No downpayment and the APR was decent at 5% for a person with no credit (I think). They mailed that contract to my parent who is my co-signer since they said that they could not get me an institution to approve a loan without one. They let me drive off with a temporary tag.

6/25 - I didn't hear from them for the longest time, so I decided to give them a call. The dealership told me that the loan did not get approved for some odd reason that I don't recall. They, however, told me that they found another institution that would approve the loan for 9% APR and a $1500 down payment. Again, I signed the contract and it was mailed to my parent.

7/22 - I got another call from the dealership saying that this loan was also denied. At this point, I had already driven about 1000 miles. I was thinking about just dropping the whole thing and returning the car. They told me that the car would go back to the factory and it would be inspected. They said that they would have to bill me for the time the car has been used.

7/25 - They told me to come in to the dealership and the only option is to do a 19% APR and $300 more down payment. At this point, I was sick and tired of all of this driving back and forth and the hassles. I signed the contract again and it has been mailed to my parent, but it has not been signed by my parent yet.

&amp;#x200B;

I did some research and it seems pretty similar to the 'yo-yo financing scam', but I just wanted to be 100% sure that I am safe to do so before I just march in there with the keys and return the car. To add to this, the dealer has gotten more and more aggressive since the beginning. 

I am also wondering about the down payment. Do I just demand for my down payment and they have to give me the down payment back?

Taking Out A Life Insurance Policy On Parents and Grandparents,"So the title says it all but I am not sure where to start. I recently found out that my grandparents do not have a life insurance policy on each other, the only thing they have is from my grandfather's pension that if he were to die my grandmother would receive $5,000 as a death benefit. I spoke to them about looking to take out a guaranteed life insurance policy that would cost them total for both plans around $200 a month that would be for around $15k each. They are looking at this option as they do not like the idea od accident as they are retired and do not plan (of course no one does) to die of an accident. Whole life is too expensive and they do not like the idea of term life because of it expiring at a certain date. (but might like the idea of a 30-year term as it is cheaper and they are almost 70 so that would be till they are 100 and they do not plan to live that long). Other than them looking to pull out a plan for each other would it be stupid if I were to pull out a plan for each of them and also for my wife's parents who are around the same age ad my grandparents (my parents had me at a very early age) ad if they and/or we were to do so, is their/out logic sound or how should we really be looking at these plans?

2. Pay $20,500 down (add $500 extra for 10%) on a $205,000 house where the seller now pays the full closing costs which I just added to my offer on the house to avoid paying it now.

The way I see it now I have 30 years to pay off either $185,000 in the first situation or $184,500 in the second situation where I kick in an extra $500.

The only problem I see in situation 1 is I’m further away from that sweet 20%. 7.5% &lt; 10%

Current recurring expenses would be car insurance (but car is totally paid off), gym membership, and Netflix.

I’m in a position to aggressively pay down my loans but I’m wondering what I should do with the following:

My employer has a 100% match of up to 5% of my salary, am currently contributing 10% (I’ve  been told I should increase this to the 19k max for 2019, but should I??) I’ve also got an emergency fund of at least 6 months already set aside, but am still setting aside 20% of my pay “just in case.”

My question is, at this point and under these circumstances, should I reduce the amount I put into my 401k to just enough to take advantage of my employer’s match, and stop setting aside that extra 20% to savings just in case, and throw all that extra money into paying off my loans?  

Will paying off my loans ASAP be better financially for my future? Or should I max out my 401k so I can take advantage of all that compound interest and be able to use that as a tax deduction?

I'm a junior in college with no family members with investing experience so they can't provide much help. I just gained access to $20,000 to begin investing and am considering all my options. I want to invest and let the money sit for at least 3-5 years if not more. The route which I understand the most and have a tad bit of experience in is buying stocks through robin hood. However, with the economy doing so well and there being a chance for another recession, I'm hesitant to invest this sort of money for it to potentially depreciate in value. I know there always is a risk with investing in stocks, but right now just seems like a lot more risk than normal. Another type of investing that I've been considering is doing one of those online, artificial investment websites, but, again, don't even know how reliable those are. Besides those two options, I'm stuck on what else I can do with this sum of money given my situation.

Can anyone give advice on high interest saving accounts?,"Hello guys, I've read advice here for awhile, and I know there's a lot of knowledgeable people. Recently, I got a raise at my job and for the first time in a long time, I am able to save, which feels crazy to me. I've been living paycheck to paycheck for what I thought might be forever.

I'm very risk averse.. don't trust financial people for the most part (they always seem to take a cut whether you make any), and seem to think of themselves mostly. Not making much money for a long time played into my risk aversion too. The rich seemed like a different species to me, oblivious and even sociopathic, towards working people's constant struggle.

All this is said to explain that I don't want to invest in something that is screwing other people over (like many financial markets often secretly do, for the sake of returns). I also don't have enough knowledge to invest in anything risky (I know they'll probably just end up taking what little I have)..

I'm hoping someone might have advice on high return savings accounts, or something else reasonably ethical and steady. Maybe I could try trading in tiny amounts, but can't risk much, and don't have much time outside my job.

Can I simultaneously afford to live and go to college or am I way in over my head?,"Hello,

I’m a bit overwhelmed and could use some financial advice. 

I’m a recent hs grad and am planning to go to college in the next couple of weeks if things go as planned. Due to some extenuating family circumstances I had to leave my moms house (in June) for my overall safety and well-being. 

This means that I am solely financially responsible for myself. I currently work full time at Fedex and make $16/hr. And have saved a little over $3k this summer. The school I plan on attending gave me dependency override and about $22k in aid, and $2k in outside scholarships. The tuition over all for the school is $30k for school related costs (books, general fees, health insurance through the school,etc.) , and I plan on living with an old family friend off campus (rent would be $150/month)


So with my calculations my cost to survive for the school year should be be between 12-13k. I pay $25/month on phone, $60-80 on gas/month, and thankfully have help from my stepdad with car insurance. 


The thing is with the school I plan to attend starting soon I would stop working at FedEx, get an on-campus or near campus job, until the holiday season, then I can come back and work at FedEx again during peak season. 

Is it reasonable for me to work to pay half of my tuition off and take loans out on the rest? And if I go with the loan route -what one is best/should I get?

Best strategic way to pay off debt for the biggest credit score boost?,"So I'm getting a big-ass check next week (yay!) and I want to use it to pay off all my consumer debt save my car loan (student loans are another story). I've got a relatively small amount of debt, but I'm a self-employed artist and make $1800 in a good month, so any debt burden is big for me. 

I currently have a Capital One credit card (shitty I know, but it was all I could get originally) and a charge account that I opened when I had to drop $450 to replace the tires on my car after a blowout in June. The charge account is with the tire store and looks like a credit card on my credit report, with a limit of $750. Balance is currently $219. The Capital One card has a limit of $500 and is nearly full. I've basically been paying the interest on it for a year since I haven't been able to afford to pay much off.

My credit score is currently in the mid 600s and I've been working to get it up. It started out in the toilet after college (again, student loans) but I'm now 26 and smarter and my accounts are older, which has helped a lot. According to Capital One's credit simulator, paying off some but not all of my debt on the two above accounts will boost my score to 720. However, paying off the tire account in full will close it, which I know will impact my credit score negatively by dropping the amount of available credit it looks like I have.

Now here's the tricky part. I want to ditch the Capital One card for a much better card through my credit union, which I will likely qualify for with a score around 700. Knowing that closing accounts impacts my score though, I would like to figure out the best way to go about this.
Do I:

a) pay off everything, close both accounts, and then apply for the new card?

b) pay off the tire account (effectively closing it) and most of the CapOne card, get the new card, and keep both cards?

c) pay off the tire account, most of the CapOne and then do a balance transfer to the new card before closing the CapOne?

d) pay off most of the tires, most of the CapOne, wait for the credit boost, and then apply for the new card, closing both old accounts after I get it?

I'm leaning towards D at the moment but having never managed accounts like this, I'm unsure of what would be most beneficial in terms of boosting my score and allowing me to get the new card.

How should I use my savings to meet these goals?,"Hey Reddit,

I’ll try to keep this as short as possible. I graduated from college in May and recently started my first full-time gig. Looking for advice on how to best use my income &amp; savings over the next few years to meet my goals below.

A little background information:

\- Gross Income: $62,500

\- Current Total Savings: $10,000

\- No Debt

\- Contributing 10% of salary to 401K (employer matches up to 8%)

\- Recently opened IRA and deposited $1,000 into it. Planning on contributing at least $3,000 more into it by year’s end.

\- My expenses are extremely low at the moment as I am living at home to save but I am planning on moving out within the next year – possibly the next couple of months. 

\- When I do move-out, I will have around $650 in net savings (not including IRA contributions) per bi-weekly paycheck. This amounts to $16,900 per year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Short-Term Goals: 

\- Purchase a car in the 5k-10k dollar range.

\- Purchase a home in the next 3-5 years that I can also rent out to 2-3 roommates. I know this is a lofty goal but it is something I hope to achieve. 

&amp;#x200B;

Long-Term Goals: 

\- Retire sooner than later. Hopefully before 60. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, my question is this: What would be the best use of my current and future savings to meet these goals? 

Should I… Deposit savings in CDs? Open a high yield savings account? Invest in bonds? Invest in stocks? Contribute more towards retirement?... What is the best use of my savings given the circumstances? Is there anything that I am overlooking here?

is it worth it to refinance my autoloan to save less than 1%? obviously that few $ i'll save won't kill me if i don't, and i am paying more than required monthly currently and plan to continue doing so. after starting tracking my finances and cutting some dead weight it's become almost addicting to keep cutting out whatever else i can. is it worth the effort for less than a percent?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cl0gqu/worth_it_to_refinance_autoloan_to_save_1/,1564727699,personalfinance

Anyone have advice on taking out a personal loan or personal experience with Lending Club that might help me pull the trigger?

Moved to the States so have no credit score here but have a well paying job. Am I likely to be refused for credit cards?,"So I recently made the move to the States for work. I had excellent credit back home but unfortunately that doesn’t follow me here. I am making 80k+ per year and was looking to get a credit card with a joining incentive (spend $x in 90 days and receive x bonus points etc) since I’m going to have a couple of big purchases associated with the move. However I am worried that if I apply and then get rejected that my credit rating will suffer and take longer to get to a score like I had at home. Currently I have a secured credit card to build my score as it currently doesn’t exist. Should I just suck it up and wait until I have a good score or is my income high enough to mitigate some of the risk?

"Knocked over motorcyle and scratched car behind, file a claim now?","I accidentally backed into a parked motorcyle and knocked it over which then caused a few minor scratches to the parked car behind it. I left a note with my contact info and insurance info. It's been about 12 hours and the motorcycle owner hasn't contacted me yet, but the car owner did. He asked if he should get a quote and settle this out of pocket or file a claim with insurance. I'm still waiting for the motorcycle owner to contact me. The more I read, the more I'm leaning towards filing a claim with my insurance and let them handle it since it won't cost me anything upfront. My car doesn't need any repairs as it was only a minor scratch on my car.

Am I understanding this correctly that I don't have a deductible for liability insurance? I'm not interested in fixing the scratch on my car, so there won't be a deductible and the only cost will be an increase to my premiums?

Saving income for future tax-deductible expenses?,"Hello all,

I am new to this world and have some very basic questions:

1. When do you need to pay taxes on income that you do not immediately spend, but plan to save for later: at the time of earning or at the time of spending?
2. What if those future expenses happen to be tax-exempted payments i.e. college tuition? Is it correct that I do not need to pay any taxes for income **intended** to be used for college tuition, no matter how much time is in between my receiving the stipend and the actual tuition payment?

Can’t get insurance due to messy legal incident from my son and “High risk” markings from SR22,"Hi! New to reddit so trying my best.

To start off, biggest probable currently is getting insurance, last year my son got into an accident while driving (stopped but biker ped hit him and my son drove away after talking to the biker and ensuring he was ok, shortly after police contacted him and the biker filed charges against my son, had license suspended and the accident was technically a “hit and run” so he’s now required to get SR22 coverage which can be very exapensive) now the problem is, since insurance company’s look at the last 5 years, when applying they said that my son has gotten 2 tickets + the legal incident + signal violation in addition my husband and son have same name so the financial compensation that the biker filed for ($50k) is on my husband AND apparently they found an accident in my name that I hit someone but I don’t ever recall hitting someone only Getting hit by someone. Anyways I’m currently with liberty mutual and they said they can insure us with the SR22 for my son but I’m scared that they will drop us once they see all the history. I have only tried applying for USAA so far and got declined due to high risk insurees. Some guidance would be helpful, preferably insurance company’s that will insure high risk, will splitting the policy’s any way help? Really anything would be great!

Cool thing I observed on my 401K funds.,"I know you're not supposed to watch your 401K daily, nor try to move money around timing the market, etc.

But some time ago, I added the ticker for all the funds available in my 401K to my Stock Market Watchlist app.  

When the market started selling on Wednesday after the FED made comments regarding the interest rate cuts, and then on Thursday the selling continued amid new fears of Tarrifs and ""trade wars,"" etc, I noticed a very funny but very satisfying thing to see.

It's kind of cool, and I felt like I was basically seeing what some people do when this kind of thing happens.

All of the tickers on my watchlist (so all of the funds available in my 401K) were all showing like minus one percent on Wednesday after close, and about the same drop on Thursday... EXCEPT the ""safe"" funds.

The 3 funds available that are labeled as ""safe"" or partially bond or however that works, those ones actually showed GREEN on both days, increasing sometimes by .5% or even .9%

I was literally seeing people move their money into those funds and out of the stock funds, right?  That has to be what that observation means?  So basically, those safe funds aren't going to start rising, they'll fall like everything else, they went green and increased because everyone was moving their money there trying to reduce the losses?

Maybe I'm completely wrong, but I feel like that's what I observed happening pretty much, and it made me feel smart lol.  (I'm not smart about market or economy at all, but felt slightly so.)

So, was I right on the mark?  Or am I clueless?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cl3eip/cool_thing_i_observed_on_my_401k_funds/,1564748612,personalfinance
Credit just dropped 64 points this month,"So my husband and I just bought a house. We both had good (mid 700’s) credit in May before we closed on our first home, and then when I checked today, it dropped 64 points! Isn’t that a little much? I’m pretty new to this real-life game, but we’ve always lived within our means, pay our cc every month, and keep our cc expenses below 30%. The last two months we’ve maxed the cc bc of moving expenses (and raised the credit limit, from $3500-$6500). I know this has affected our credit score too, but 64 points? We bought a smaller home with the intention of being able to get a new truck as well (necessary for our climate), but now our credit is so low we’re struggling to get a loan. 

Is this normal, or should I be digging deeper into why our credit score was hit so hard?

confused about credit card balance,"hello, 
I recently just got my first credit card and I am confused about credit utilization with regard to my balance.  I understand that whatever my balance is at the time that my next payment is due will equal my recorded balance for that month and therefore that will be the number that they use to calculate utilization.  i read that it's good to have a 30% utilization so that you are using your credit but that you are not exceeding your abilities to pay it back.  what I am confused about is that it seems to me like I am perpetually keeping 30% of my credit allowance as my balance.  it seems like I should just leave 30% unpaid by the time my payment is due so that they can count it instead of paying it off in full.  is this the correct strategy to have or should I just pay everything off as soon as I spend it instead?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/cl3hzv/confused_about_credit_card_balance/,1564749166,personalfinance

I have no other debts.

I know this is alot to take in. But i am trying to figure out what i should do to make sure i am well prepared for life and if i have made any huge mistakes or if i am doing ""ok""

I know a car payment is a bad idea, but i was young and needed one. Do you all think i should sell it and get a cheap one cash?

the appliances are for the house. it needed all new ones. Should i pay these off first then the car, or becuase its 0% i should throw more at the car?
