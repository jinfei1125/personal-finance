Employer is increasing pay rate with retro acting pay increase over 30 days. Can it still be taxed?,"So long story short, my employer is giving us a living wage increase. The new pay rate starts January 1 and all pay thats owed will be paid out on the first check of February. So in essence we'll see the difference in our pay rate for whatever hours worked during that month. A co worker told me that her accountant said that we can be tax exempt on that amount.

How do I settle with a debt collector?,"I have $22,693 of student loans in default with my University for Fall of 2016. It has since been sent to General Revenue Service. I spoke with my representative for EAP who suggested saving $8,000 to propose as a settlement with them. My questions for all of you is:

1. How much do you think they will actually settle for?
2. How should I go about asking to settle?
3. What documents should I ask for prior to settling and how should I ask for when attempting to settle?

I’m an extremely untrained 24 y/o regarding my debts and need serious help. If you think the best route is to consult with a licensed financial advisor please let me know. I bank with BofA currently and honestly don’t know what I’m doing. 

On top of this debt in collections I have around $100k in student loans and am making my monthly payments towards this, as well as some additional payments. I make about $55k per year.

What can I do to get the very cheapest Auto Insurance? (No Accidents),"I'm 27/m and I just cleared off two tickets for unlicensed operation for dumb mistakes committed when I was 18.

"My boyfriend is currently the ""breadwinner"" but is terrible with managing money","Hi personalfinance,

My boyfriend and I made a big move, lived with my family for a little while, and then he was offered a job (55k). We moved out of my family's house knowing that I didn't have work yet and wouldn't be able to pay my portion of the rent until I got work. I had a job offer at one point but he encouraged me to wait for something better, knowing it was not exactly on the career path that I had been pursuing. He has been paying for most of our expenses for the last three months.

Cut to today when he realizes he has been over-drafting with every debit purchase since Dec. 14. The letters were being mailed to our old address at my family's home, and they have been away. He grew up poor, has some anxiety issues, and is avoidant about looking at his bank account.

I didn't know this had been going on but had previously offered to help him with YNAB or even take over his budgeting for him, since I knew the avoidance was there. He was totally excited about the idea – it just never quite came to happen, partially because the couple of occasions where I asked him to do it with me, he said he was just too tired, and partially because I felt a little weird about the idea of managing his money. For those Freudian analysts out there, I don't think he's being avoidant out of fear of me managing it; he seemed genuinely relieved at the idea and it seems more like he doesn't want to face his own bank account.

So... does anyone have any recommendations about steps moving forward? How to get this under control? It seems like now I need to hustle to get a job, any job, ASAP... but how do I get this under control in the long term? How do I make a budget and tell somebody they need to buy less of x, y or z when they're the one paying my rent? Or is there another way? We've been together for four years; this is freaking me out a little.

Of course, I am grateful for the fact that he's been paying the rent for the last few months. But this is a bit of a wake-up call.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a9agc7/my_boyfriend_is_currently_the_breadwinner_but_is/,1545698481,personalfinance
Frontload my 401(k) in 2019?,"UPDATE: I did a calculation and determined that the following seems to make sense:

\- I'm going to contribute 50% to my traditional 401(k) for the first two months of 2019

\- I'll set the remainder of the year at 2% contribution to ensure I still get the company match. Will invest the extra amounts in my existing IRA + some brokerage funds.

All said, that will allow me to hit the limits on both by EOY.

Thanks for the suggestions, everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

\---------

Hello - and happy holidays to you all.

My employer allows me to contribute up to 100% of my income to my 401(k) if I so desire, and I'm thinking of doing so for the first few months of the year while the market is in a trough. Basically I could have my 401(k) maxed out within the first three months of the year if I chose this route.

The situation: my company matches up to 1% of salary, I have the option of contributing either to a Roth or Traditional 401(k), and I have more than enough in my emergency fund + checking that would cover my expenses if I chose to frontload.

If I didn't go this route, I'd likely contribute 9% of my income to my 401(k) and place the remaining income less expenses in my emergency fund (aka a high-yield interest account and rotating 1-year CDs) for a bit.

Appreciate any thoughts/suggestions!

I purchased a computer from [bestbuy.com](https://bestbuy.com) on 11/25 for $678 but  it did not go through because of my bank daily spending limits according to my bank when I called them. I then withdrew $678, went to the store same day, and bought the same computer so I can get it for $678. I went home to find out that the original order has gone through so I called my bank and asked for a refund and to cancel the orignial [bestbuy.com](https://bestbuy.com) order because I was told that it did not go through due to my spending limit. The computer from the original order arrived anyway and my bank gave me $678 \*temporary credit\* and noted it as an unauthorized transaction.

Credit Card was not cancelled,"Got myself into quite the predicament. I am young and I purchased a piece of jewelry some time ago. I was offered to open a ""Kay Jewelers Card"" which to my understanding was just a rewards card of sorts.

Debt optimization,"I’m a mathematically minded individual. My friend recently came to me with the following problem:

Suppose I have $5000 per month to allocate to loans A,B, C every month. How would allocate the $5000 every month to each of the following loans in order to minimize my total amount paid plus any remaining balance in, say, 30 years. 

Loan A: 100000, 3% fixed till 2020 then 8% fixed 
Loan B: 200000, floating rate (prime + 3%), has an option to convert to fixed at 7%
Loan C: 250000, floating rate (prime + 4%) till 2025 then fixed at 8% thereafter 

Note that the remaining balance is only non-zero if you accrue capitalized interest.

As a general rule of thumb, loans with higher interest rates should be paid off first, but that’s not the case in all examples. The differing sizes of loans, interest rate structure etc. all come into play. 

So basically, I wrote a giant optimization algorithm to solve this problem for an arbitrary number of loans. Would this be of use to people on this sub? Would you like me to share this program? Would it be helpful?

Have a lovely day!

What are the penalties for late payment of (self-employed) estimated taxes?,"I started doing some contract work on the side earlier this year, and didn't realize that I was supposed to pay estimated quarterly tax payments to the IRS. However, a friend told me he didn't think it was a big deal, since the interest penalties are fairly small and it basically cancels out if I'm putting the income into a savings account or decently investing it anyways. (I'm not sure if this is true or not.)

I'm having trouble finding out what exactly the penalties are, though. For example, if I made $10K in Mar 2018, how much in penalties am I paying for each month late after I miss the quarterly tax deadline? I'm confused because some websites I find seem to say that each for additional month late, the monthly penalty is 5% of the tax I owed (which seems very large), other sites seem to say the monthly penalty is 0.5% (which also seems large if I consider that a year late would then mean 12 \* 0.5% = 6%), etc.

I would probably prefer paying the taxes now, even if they're late, but I'm confused about all this and can't find any good information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a9awyd/what_are_the_penalties_for_late_payment_of/,1545702560,personalfinance
Stay contractor overseas or go back to the States as a government employee?,"BLUF - I have a feeling the answer will be to stay Overseas, but let’s find out. 

Information about my wife and myself. I am. U.S citizen and she is Philippine. We are near getting her Green card. We are both 35. We have hit our financial peak for two years now. 

I work for a large contracting firm for the DoD. This is our current income/debt/assets 

Annual income
- 150,000 (husband)
- 35,000 (wife)

Debt
- zero

Assets 
- 130,000 land in Philippines
- 100,000 401k
- 30,000 savings
- 15,000 gold
- 10,000 in ETF
- 10,000 car
- 3,000 car

Currently we pay no state tax or federal tax due to foreign tax exclusion, maxing out 401k and standard deductions. 

Out rent is roughly 20,000 a year. 

If we move back to the states my job would be as a GS (government employee) again. I would make 116,000 but now subject to state and federal tax. My wife would have a much more difficult time getting a job that pays as well as she currently makes. She will also be taxed. 

This type of government job is one that only becomes available once a decade due to people never leaving it. 116,000 is a lot for the area (average joint income is around 48,000. 

The job is extremely fulfilling and difficult which is what I like. What I do now I enjoy, but it is not challenging and I have no authority. 

Do I do the smart thing and just stick it out another five years overseas? We are at the point where we max out my 401k. I put another 20,000 in the ETF. My wife saves 100% in her savings account (she is not eligible for a 401k due to not being US). I expect to save about 50,000 in cash this year on top of all the above. 

The original idea was to do this for five more years to be able to buy a house in full when going back to the states. This “once in a lifetime” GS job is so compelling though. 

Any words of wisdom?

My early 30s has done damage to my savings and any feasible retirement plan....,"My situation has been tough to even save money as it currently stands

I keep constantly diving into my savings for things I need. I have about 900 in savings, and my wages are garnished because of child support. Based on my current income, I can't afford my own place so I'm stuck living with my parents who have let me live rent free since they see I can't afford a place of my own here in NJ, where the rents just keep going higher and higher. I have a 3 year old son that I split time with. I recently filed for Joint Physical Custody, which hopefully will lower child support payments since I will be spending way more time with him.

I have a 401k that I currently put 1 percent of my wages towards it. However, I have a savings account that I have access to and tend to dive into whenever things are getting tight. I have no automatic savings deductions at the moment. I'm several months away from paying off a pre-owned car that I got in 2013 so when June rolls around, I'll have an extra 300 dollars a month. My credit cards aren't too high, but I had to unfortunately run up one of my cards because of costly car repairs (broken axle, oxygen sensor replacements) which put one of my cards up to a 1000 dollar balance. I pay a little over the minimum for that card. I pay about 150 dollars a month for full coverage on this car. My 401k has been hovering around the same balance over the last year or so due to random down turns in the market (usually between 10k or 11k). I'm a full time student in university. Thank God I'm in there with a full scholarship at the moment because of  a high GPA from my community college. However, once I'm done with schooling, I then gotta worry about paying back the loans in a few years.

I feel so damn lost at this moment. I know some good advice is to always have a few months of emergency savings in the bank, and I don't even have that. I don't want access to my savings because of the bad habit of diving into them. My understanding of the 401k is minimal at best. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right with the current 1% I'm putting into it.  

Anyone have any advice on what I should be doing at this point?

EDIT: Brain vomit, forgot to at least write down my financial situation.

Paid biweekly about $790 dollars, $1,580 a month (This should go up considerably due to a raise that took effect today)

**Monthly Expenses**

**Car Payment**: $299.86 due on the 11th of each month (will be finished paying car off in June 2019)

**Cell Phone Bill**:  $4.00 a month thru June 2019 (Sprint Free Year Plan, where I only pay the taxes)

**Food**: I eat out a lot because of work...my guess around 50 to 60 dollars a week)

**Child Support**: $540 a month garnished (hoping this goes down once I get joint physical custody of my son)

**Car Insurance** $143.04 due on the 28th of each month for ""full coverage"" thru GEICO

I'm living with my mom in the rented room.

I have many loans which takes 70% of my salary.  (I think if i made a loan, i can help my mom somehow but she lied to me and get my money to pay off her loans instead).

My mom is still getting my money to maintain her cafe shop. And we have some troubles about understanding each others in money problem.

I plan to start saving but she just take my money to maintain her shop.  I lost all the savings now.

I really can't stay like this any longer and i want to move out.

However in my country, people will talk bad about me because of i'm not qualified to be a son. From any direction i'm on the wrong side because i'm her son and she has been taking care of me since the child.

But i really want to move out and stay independent now. But i wonder if my mom can live by herself because she is old now (50+ age).

Currently, i have a small bonus from the end year salary bonus. It is possible to pay off 1 or 2 of my loans.  

I'm eating noodles for a whole month to save budget now. But i need a plan for future.

The question is:

Should i pay off all the loans (and wait for months to save some budget to invest in myself) or invest in myself (education, learning other language) while keeping the loans ?

Should i help my mom by giving some of my salary every month so she can live on ? Because i want to save some budget for more education and it seems it will be a total waste with her living style.

Is it a horrible idea to buy a $500 house for fun?,"Hey yall, first post here. I've had some strange ideas in my head the last few days, and I've been toying with the idea of buying a dirt cheap house.

I'm not worried about the cost of repairing it, because as far as I know I would only have to go as far as I chose to. I figure at such a low cost the project would be low risk, but I'm only 20 so i have no idea what I'm doing. Are there any hidden costs that could blindside me? Are such cheap houses garunteed to have squatters or black mold or something that makes them inherently unlivable? How easy would it be to cut ties if shit starts hitting the fan, could I give the property to the government or something? Thanks in advance for your wisdom.

Edit: for more context I have student loans, a job and I dont pay rent at the moment.

High 401K expense ratio! What do I do? Help me.,"Hi. Help me please. We only have 7 or so funds in our 401k plan. Company matches up to 3.5%. The best plan (lowest expense ratio) is FMKXK at 1.11%. This is way more than Vanguard IRAs that I was investing in before our company adopted a 401K. 

They do have a Roth and pretax option. I’m splitting 50/50 between both. 

I’m in a position to max out my contributions. 

I know it’s “smart” to max out generally but is there a trade off point? 

Should I stop and just buy into this “cheap” market in 2019? 

Any advice would be seriously appreciated. I can’t feel like the only one “trapped” in a mediocre 401k plan.

Applying to colleges where I’ll likely have to pay around 35-55k in tuition for a BFA in Acting. I feel like I should just accept the debt I’m getting myself into. Need some advice,"Just some brief background I graduated high school already and am applying to college. I have an average SAT score and average grades so my chances for academic scholarships are low. I excel at theatre and think there’s a good chance for me to receive a merit or talent scholarship. Middle class family so I’ll I wanna say an average aid of 12-15k for a school. 

If I go to one of these more expensive schools(that I truly want to go to and have worked hard to try and get into) I’ll be paying a lot in tuition. Its likely that I’ll over over 100k in tuition easily. 

Is it reasonable for me to just pay a small amount every month to pay it off? Can I just pay an amount slightly more than the minimum requirement and leave it at those payments for as long as it takes? I know that I’d pay MUCH more in the end through the accumulated interest but that’s all I can think to do. 

Am I just thinking completely recklessly? What should I consider? I guess I could go to community college and then transfer but with BFA programs I would still have to spend 3-4 years at that program. So it would be 2 year at CC and 3-4 elsewhere and not 2 at CC and 2 elsewhere.

Filing Taxes for Next Year - Two Different States,"This past year (2018) I've had multiple jobs and have a few questions about filing taxes related to it. I am from New York and my state ID reflects that.

My timeline that explains a bit more:

* **2017:** I went to graduate school in Washington, DC. After I graduated at the end of the year, I had planned to move back to NY but was offered a short term job (next bullet).
* **January-May 2018:** I stayed in DC and accepted a short term job there. My main address on my paystub was my NY address and that was also where my state tax was taxed out of.
* **May-July 2018:** I moved back to NYC and worked a retail job for a few months. Again, state tax was taxed out of NY.
* **August-December 2018:** I moved to DC for a permanent salaried job and listed my DC address on the paystub/for tax purposes. My DC address is my main address, but I never changed my state ID to a DC one (never had the chance to wait at the DMV and also didn't know if it was necessary).

For filing taxes this year, what will happen since I am being taxed out of two states? Does it matter that my state ID is still from NY, even though I live in DC and am getting taxed DC rates for my current job? Do I have to change my ID to a DC ID? I don't own a car/have a car in DC and don't plan on getting one so I don't need it for driving purposes.

Need some help with a question in my Finance course (risk-neutral pricing),"I think this is quite difficult, but I give it a try over here. Basically we received this exam question prior to the exam itself, because it is considered to be *that* challenging by the professor.

This is the setup:

- the derivative is European (only pays out at the end of the contract 1 year from now)
- payoff of the derivative = max(Smax-K; 0)
- Smax is the maximum observed price between now (t) and the end of the contract (T = t + 1) 
- K is the strike price 
The derivative hence locks in the maximum price gain above K.
 
Consider the following situation: 
current price of the asset S(t) = 110; K = 100 

Compute the current price of the derivative, using the binomial tree approach on the basis of a partition of time in three levels t = 1 = 3

- upstate u(Δt= 1/3) = 1.2 
- d(Δt= 1/3) = 1/1.2 
- gross interest rate over the interval Δt= 1/3 is given by Rf (Δt= 1/3) = 1.05

"Roth IRA over contribution, backdoor possible?","I have an employer sponsored 401k and have been over the income limit for deducting Traditional IRA contributions since I started the position, but was under the income limits on Roth IRA.  So, my wife and I opened Roth IRA accounts and maxed the contributions in prior years (i.e. we have only after-tax money in Roth IRAs, no funds in a Traditional IRA).  We maxed the contributions early in 2018 as well, but mainly due to an unusually high bonus we will cross the combined income limit that reduces or eliminates the allowable contribution and so have over contributed unless we take corrective action.

&amp;#x200B;

I've read that one way to handle this situation is to ""recharacterize"" the contributions into a Traditional IRA.  However, since the backdoor Roth involves converting (is this the same as recharacterizing?) a Traditional IRA into a Roth IRA, would I be able to recharacterize this year's Roth into a Traditional and then convert that Traditional back into the Roth I was trying to contribute to in the first place?  If so, would I do it in the same year or need to wait for a later year for the Traditional to Roth conversion?

(26 yrs old) Need help on bettering my finances ($20k in checking/$42k student loans/no idea where my paycheck goes...),"Long post, warning in advanced.

**Overview**:


I am 26 years old, living at home with my parents (NJ), commuting to NYC for work (worked at current job for a year now). I make annually $65k a year before taxes. Bi-weekly take home pay is ~$1500.  

**Checking/Savings Accounts overview:**

I had a windfall few years ago for about $20k which is sitting my checking account and try to not touch. Another separate checking account which I opened short after working and I automatically deposit $250 (deducted from bi-weekly) and a savings account both thru Wells Fargo, so I receive $1 in my savings whenever I use my checking and have $570 in my savings.


**Investments overview:**

As of now I maxed out my Employers 401k at 6% and have ~$3,570. Also, opened a Roth IRA with Vanguard about 2 years ago and have $10k (currently dropping with recent market performance) and have less than $500 in a Robinhood account for miscellaneous stocks.

**Debts overview:**

I have student loans that are at $42,431 and my monthly payment that I began to pay in June 2018 is $450 a month, but paid a bit extra in the beginning and currently pay $500 per month. I have 3 credit cards with a total balance of $2783. 

**Problem**
 
Since I began my job in NYC I have always noticed how little money I save each month! I recently began using Clarity Money to keep track how I am spending my money and since October I have made around $9000 and spent approximately $7600 (according to the Clarity app). 

One big expense for me was food, I would go out for lunch everyday since I began working and would be at a minimum of $10 per day. As a result I am making my own lunch and limiting the amount of times I go out for lunch.

It kills me inside knowing I am somewhat wasteful with my income, although I constantly trying to stay on top of my finances, but if I keep this up I will get no where anytime soon.

Any help at all would be much appreciated.

I am currently a sophomore attending a private university that costs roughly 70k per year. My parents combined have little to no steady income,  one of my parents has been unemployed for over a year, and both of their credit is awful. Upon applying to school, my tuition was being paid for by a ""project"" from a distant family member, and thus I chose the university I attend albeit getting roughly 12k in financial aid from this institution as opposed to nearly full rides from 2 other schools that are also top 40 universities. (Awful decision, I'm aware, but I can't change the past at this point and my parents pushed for this)

Anyways, this project fell through in September, and the funds for my tuition have been pulled. I initially thought I could simply take out loans in my name for the remanning costs. However, I realized that is obviously not the case. I can finish paying for my sophomore year, but I am responsible for 55k my junior and senior year. I have appealed twice for my financial aid with no luck and am looking to meet with an advisor to argue my case, but I fail to understand how I could be getting such a small sum when my family is so poor. I could transfer to a state school, but I currently have a 3.6 at a top 35 school in a STEM major and I feel like that would go to waste if I transfer to a state school.

Is it likely the schools that offered nearly full rides would do so again? Is it likely I can convince an advisor to gain money because essentially I need to drop out if I cannot? Can someone give more insight on loans?

I have read that providing you keep putting money towards shares, even if the stock market falls, such as it is right now, 20-30 years down the line, providing you haven't freaked out and sold, your account will be worth much more money! 

This is apparently due to 2 reasons from what I gather.

1st reason: Compound interest
2nd reason: The market always goes up apart from the occasional downtrend as we are going through right now

How much truth is there to this?

Is there a risk, even if it's small, that the market could keep continuing to go down and not go back up?

Sorry if I sound naive, that's because I am lol I don't know too much about this kind of thing but I am keen to learn!

"I'm 31, 45K in debt with no clue on how to pay them off, and have nada in savings. Super freaking out now that I want to plan my future, any help would be greatly appreciated!","Hi PF,

I'm probably in one of the worst places a 31 year old can be, financially. Especially in the Bay Area. I've spent money willy nilly for almost 8 years straight. Now that I want to plan for my future, I'm **absolutely freaking out internally** (as I should be) because of how supremely I've fucked myself over. I've botched it as supremely as Da Vinci drew Mona Lisa. I have a sense of humor about these things, so I've got that going for me, which is nice. Unfortunately comedy isn't the trade I ply, so it won't feed me or pay my bills. This is my roundabout plea for help. What better Xmas gift for myself other than a nice big dose of financial responsibility?

Here is what I owe (not counting student loans, which is ~20K):

| Credit Card | Balance     | Minimum Pay  | APR          |
|:------------|------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| AMEX        |      5397.55|     357      | 29.99
| Chase Frdm  |      6300.62|     160      | 19.24   
| Chase Saphr |    19,202.98|     455      | 17.99
| Barclaycard |      2367.27|     52.65    | 14.99
| Paypal      |      1940.85|     69.43    | 19.99
| Citi Costco |      7800.33|     199.36   | 17.24
| Car loan    |       444.99|     324.28   |  6.00
| **TOTAL**   |**43,454.26**|  **1617.72** |  **--**


My income is ~5500 a month after taxes (and maxing out my 18K of retirement - which I only did at the beginning of this year when I turned 30).

Here are almost all my expenses:

| Expense   | Amount   |
|:----------|---------:|
|Rent	    |1900
|Phone 	    |70
|Net / TV   |200
|Stdnt Loans|400
|Minimums   |1617.72
|Car	    |325
|Gas	    |150
|AMC A List |20
|Netflix    |15
|Linode	    |10
|AAPL Music |10
|Goo Drive  |2
|Dropbox    |10
|iCloud Drv |1
|**TOTAL**  |**4730.72**

I'm pretty much left with ~500 after setting aside $250 for food. What I would like is a game plan to get me out of this hole. Ideally something I can check on a daily basis to make sure I don't stray off my track. Maybe a burn down chart? How do I even budget?! I'm so lost and confused, and blaming myself heavily for doing this to myself. I can't talk to my friends about it because this is WAY too embarrassing (and I have this one friend who sometimes tells me he has a problem, which is having too much money and not knowing what to do with it - I told him to go enjoy life - which is the kindest way I can tell him to go fuck right off - and then I feel depressed and miserable that I'm in this situation). Which makes me feel immature for feeling that way, and that makes me more depressed. It's such a vicious cycle that I can't take it anymore. I started reading the book ""Your money or your life"" and a book title has never hit me harder.

I know need a side hustle and the only one I can think of is being a Doordash / Uber food delivery person (or take up a job on the weekends or both? I don't know where I can find weekend only gigs though). My car is a 2 seater Miata so I can't Lyft/Uber. 

[It feels like what I need is the help of a financial planner but I can't afford one, clearly. So that's why I'm here.](https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201448/rs_500x220-140508105809-tumblr_mf6wvtEUVE1r6w7e0o1_500_large.gif)


.... it's 2:25am PST on Xmas Day. I'm so depressed financially it feels like my post is going to sink the bottom and never get any real / substantial help in planning for my future. If that's the case I hope a repost won't have horrible consequences :). Also I feel like nobody would want to be with me (I started seeing someone and I care for them a lot), which is why planning for my future is now the only thing I care about.

**EDIT**: ... it's 9:15am and I just woke up to shitloads of comments! I'm completely overwhelmed by the support and response, and it will take me some time to grok everything. The amount of support makes me feel like this is not an unsurmountable challenge, which is the best I can ask for at this point. Also /u/ironicosity - I was just sleeping (I posted this and went to bed at 2:30am or later), so I'm sorry I didn't partake in the discussion until now. I'll try to acknowledge comments individually now that I'm awake. Some quick updates though:

**RENT:** I live in the South Bay in a rent controlled area so moving isn't particularly the best option for me. I'd rather cut my expenses somewhere else, and I can probably get someone to move in with me by March after I donate / sell just about everything I don't need (a laptop, some books, and basic cookware is all I absolutely require).

**SUBSCRIPTIONS:** I have cancelled all of the subscriptions I can think of except what is noted above. I'm willing to cut out everything but AMC - my date and I are super avid movie buffs and I watch 3 movies a week on a consistent basis, and I don't buy anything from concessions. Outside of hanging out with people it's really the only thing I look forward to.

**CAR:** I think it would be absolutely stupid to get rid of it. If I were in SF I'd get rid of it in a heartbeat but where I live I find it impossible to get anything done without a car. I used to do it and everything took at least an hour longer. It takes me places that I need to get to and I'd rather use it to get some more money on the side, especially since it's almost paid off. I got it used for 10K with 30K miles on it so it'll serve me well for the next 5 years easy.

Obligatory thanks for the gold, stranger! Of all my years lurking, this is what gets me gold, haha. Thanks again, whoever you are!

Investing in Vanguard Mutual Funds,"First off, Merry Holiday (whatever you celebrate, I don't judge) everyone!

With the new year right around the corner, I'm coming to ask how to find a mutual fund to invest in. I'm in the process of signing up for a Vanguard account (I'm 17), so the next step is to find what to invest in! I have roughly $2000 to invest, and I wanted to invest it in a medium-high risk fund for tech/science. I really don't understand this stuff and I have to learn so I can start saving some money. I'm hopefully getting a job soon, so I can contribute to the fund, and my understanding is that it's long term, correct? Like 20-25 years long or shorter?

After looking at the list of stuff and trying to filter it out, I'm left with ~50 funds ([image here](https://i.imgur.com/padlIzY.png)). Can anyone advise me on what to invest in? Should I even invest at all with the market?

"~$30k in credit card debt, 21 and need help...","Hello all, I really needed help as this has been keeping me up at night and giving me anxiety a lot especially lately. 

I am 21, married, and have almost $30,000 in credit card debt. I am looking for a way through this. 

I make $21 /hr and get paid bi monthly (~$1600 twice a month on 10th and 25th). My wife is full time in school. 

Recently, we reached the max on our $15k limit credit card which has a 17.5% interest rate. It hurt when I saw a $280 interest charge on it be posted and just feel completely stuck at this point. Our other card is $9,600 at 7.99% and is maxed as well. We have a couple other cards (PayPal, Amazon, Macy’s) that are each sitting around $1,500. 

Most of this was racked up before I started making how much I make now. I used to make roughly $2200 per month. Our bills add up to that. Here is a list of our bills excluding credit card minimum payments: 

-	Rent: $750
-	Electricity: ~$100
-	Health insurance: $46
-	Dental insurance: $40
-	Car payments: $350 ($240+$110)
-	Car and renters insurance: $192
-	Gas: $~200
-	Furniture: $139 ($71+$68)
-	BestBuy: $150
-	Internet: $55
-	Cell phones: $195
-	Gym: $43 (both my wife and I go)
-	Storage: $44
-	Various streaming services: $60 (Hulu, DirecTV Now, Netflix, Spotify)
-	CareCredit: $50 (almost done, paying a surgery)

A few disclaimers here: the storage unit we have to store my military uniforms that I’m obligated to have but have no room in our tiny apartment for, and consequentially we have other stuff in there that also can’t fit. Our internet I already haggled down from $70. My wife and I both have cars and public transportation isn’t really an option as the timing just doesn’t work (having to wait like half an hour for a bus when we have to be somewhere at x time). She has a 30mpg car which we owe about $10k/$15k on and mine is about 16mpg which I’ve wanted to get rid of for a more fuel efficient one but discovered I’m underwater and owe $3k/4.2k on a car worth about $1k. Poo. The high gas spending is because my wife has to go back and forth between locations for her schooling (some of her classes are 10-15 miles apart) and my work is 22 miles round trip which makes my commute about $4. Ultimately my wife drives quite a bit more than me and it’s more town miles and random so she has the more fuel efficient car whereas mine is all highway so I get the tank. 

My question ultimately is: what’s the best way to beat credit card debt? I tried debt consolidation but got denied by one place and the other one offered a “deal” on a 36% APR consolidation loan. Guess my credit score isn’t good enough for the lower APRs (duh? What do they expect...). I struck this from my options as my credit cards are all well below that interest rate so I’d be better off paying them off directly instead. 

I’ve been told to try contacting my bank to have them stop the interest on my cards and let me pay them off if possible, and that they may agree with the asterisk being that they would close my cards. Is this a good idea? If I’ll be getting charged $280 in interest per month now the biggest thing to make a dent in it is to stop that. 

I’ve looked into potential balance transfer cards but none can offer a big enough credit limit to truly offer consolidation that’s worthwhile or would be willing to give me the credit limit with my low credit score. I’m currently at a 620 credit score. 

If anyone could please help me I would greatly appreciate it. 

Edit: my wife will soon be a teacher (starting around January of 2020) and be making $50k per year. We could possibly get by until then just paying the minimums and then once she starts making that much we can rapidly pay down but I’d like to get a head start if possible and have a solid plan in action.

"30M, unsure of what to start doing with money.","After tax income is $2,600 biweekly, so about $5,633 per month. Monthly bills are about $1,700 since I live at home and just have to pay my car expenses and student loans. No credit card debt or any other debt. I have ~$160,000 in my bank account. Not sure what my 401k is but I've been making the max contributions my workplace offers.

So about my expenses, the car loan is 0% interest so I don't see a value in paying that off early, and my student loans are too high to ever reasonably pay off so I think I'm better off letting IBR forgive it in 18 more years. 

So really what I want to know is what to do with that $160k I have sitting around, and the almost $3,000 per month surplus I have from my paychecks. It's currently in a .03% savings account which I realize is dumb so I'm opening a high yield savings, but I know keeping that much in even a high yield savings is considered bad. But keeping in mind that I may want to buy a condo or house in the next few years, and so can't lock it into any long term investment, I'm not sure what else to do with it.

Opening an IRA by rolling over funds from 403 b,"I just got a new job and am looking to buy a house. Thinking about using my 403 b money from my old employer for a downpayment by rolling it over into an IRA because I heard you can withdraw up to 10,000 without penalty from that? In shopping through the company my new employer offers a 403 through, they require 5,000 to open an IRA account. I'm not wanting to roll over the old 403 into the new one because if I do that and then withdraw from it I won't be able to put anything into it for 6 months and that throws off my employer's eventual match plan (they told me that). 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, if I open this IRA and quickly withdraw the money for a downpayment, what is going to happen? Does it have to stay in there a certain amount of time? There also seem to be two types of IRAs - brokerage and express mutual fund? What's the difference? I also see there's annual maintenance fees so I feel like there's more to this than just rolling it over and using it. How can I not get screwed more than I already am by having to tap into this money? Is it just better to close the old 403 b, take the money, and just get penalized? Rolling it over seems so complicated and I really just want what's easiest. A place to live is more important to me than retirement at this point. Hell, I may not even live long enough to see retirement.

Hello all, 

I'm a highschool senior that has just gotten into Stanford. I'm international, so I did not get any financial aid.

My mother gave me two options: either she pays for Stanford or she gives me $300,000.

To be clear, I fortunately will not have to go into debt to study at Stanford. 

I'm leaning towards Stanford tbh (once in a lifetime opportunity?) , but I'm not sure if it's worth 300,000.

We're quite comfortable, but this sum could give a nice cushion for the rest of my life. My mother has told me that this will be the last sum of money she will give me (to be clear, I'm very grateful for her help).

I know the advice is to simply not do it, but please only address the how-to-withdraw with minimal penalties/max $$$ at the end. Thank you!

"(CAN) 20 y/o with savings over $10'000, how should I invest?","I am a 20 year old former post secondary student with no student loans. My only expenses right now are rent (640 per month) and car payments (600~ per month). As for savings I have $6500 in my savings account with my bank, and $3500~ in cash (as I am a server). 

I know I should not have this much cash on me but I do not want to deposit it as I would then need to claim it on my taxes. (I think someone please correct me if I'm wrong).

Do I pay a $78 bill I don't owe or fight it? They are threatening collections.,"My dentist over-charged me on a visit. I brought this up to him and he said he wouldn't charge me on another visit a week later. He told his secretary (also runs his billing) just before the 2nd visit. However, I got a $78 bill. My wife had to get her teeth cleaning a few days later and she brought it up and the dentist told the same secretary to drop the bill.

I got a letter about the $78 bill. I called the office and the secretary said she would not drop the bill and it would go to collections on 12/28, she also mentioned to me the bill was never a mistake.

Clearly this person will not drop the bill. Should I pay $78 or take the ding on the credit and try to fight it? Also I am going to a apply for a business loan in about 9 months, so I'm leaning towards paying it.

Update: called the dentist and ended up paying the bill. Dentist said insurance company is to blame. He said they wouldn't cover white fillings on mollars. He also admitted they didn't run insurance but knew they wouldn't cover it.

"Selling condo, what to do with proceeds of sale in bull market / maybe looming recession?","I inherited a condo from my mother last year. While it is paid off and I can afford to maintain it, it basically prevents me from saving, so I have resolved to sell it. It is not a particularly good investment property as it is in an area mostly populated by fixed income retirees, so property values have historically just tracked inflation.

I expect to get $100,000 - $110,000 for it, and it would free up about $7,000 / year in cash flow. However, I am looking at the markets and it seems like the general consensus is that a recession is on the horizon, so I am really wondering what to do with those proceeds. Ultimately I'd like to invest it toward an ultimate goal of purchasing a retirement home in ~15  years. I have about $20,000 in cash savings now, am in a state pension system, and fully fund an IRA every year. 

My initial thought was to take advantage of the recession dip and invest in an index fund, opening the account with $10,000 or so, and then dollar cost average the rest in over a year or two.

"I don’t need my car anymore, but I don’t want to be upside down either","Hey, all! 

So I recently was diagnosed with a medical condition that prevents me from driving anymore. I really don’t wanna keep paying hundreds of dollars a month to have insurance and a loan on a car I can’t use, especially when everyone I live with has a car of their own. 

However, thing is, I got this car before I had pretty much any credit, so I still owe more on it than it’s worth. It’s not a HUGE discrepancy, but it’s enough that I can’t pay it all at once in the foreseeable future.

I’ve been doing a little research on this, but all I can really find are resources for people who just want a different car as opposed to just not having a car altogether. It’s a huge pain having this car I can’t use sitting there losing value and costing me money constantly, and I’d really like to not do that anymore.

Default on Car Loan - - Can I still pay it before repo?,"[Update] They hadn't even taken action, probably due to the holidays. I'm all caught up and made an extra payment as well! 

I'm irresponsible. I'll admit that. My car has not been repossessed yet, but I have the amount plus several hundred to catch up with the loan (I wanted to pay it off in one lump sum but I don't have that much). I know my credit is going to take a hit, but will I be able to call the lienholder and pay it back to keep the loan?

They sent me a certified letter--but it went to the wrong address. They had the correct address on the letter, but for some reason USPS sent it to my mother in law's house. Last chance was 12/21. They're closed today, and for some reason I can't log on to make a payment. I'm terrified of losing my car (can't even drive it due to deceased relative having been a cosigner, so I can't register it, but I'm so close to paying it off).

"I just discovered my parents see a financial planner who charges them 1% of their TOTAL retirement fund per year. Is this normal, or are they being taken advantage of?","**Edit/bottom line up front:** 1% of AUM is a fairly standard fee, and although it doesn’t preclude shady activity it isn’t indicative of it either. 

**Original Post**: 
My parents are approaching retirement (within 5-10 years for both of them). While home for Christmas, my dad offered to take me along to meet with their financial advisor/planner so that I can have a better understanding of their estate in case something happens to them. He mentioned that he charges them 1% of their total retirement to manage their money. I did double check to verify that he charges 1% of the TOTAL money, and not 1% of the growth, and it’s of the total. I‘m not sure what his exact credentials/licensing is, and neither do my parents. I know that they like him personally because he‘s nice, used to be a preacher, and seems to care about what they want to do with their money and what their personal goals are, but to me this feels predatory. 1% of the total fund being managed seems to be, at best, a complete rip off.


Is this normal and I‘m just overreacting, or am I correct that this seems shady? If it is, do you guys have any recommendations for how I approach my parents regarding this? I obviously don‘t want to imply that they‘re dumb, or make them feel defensive about their choices, I just want them to have good financial/retirement practices. 


**edit**: Thank you everyone for the advice. 

It seems like this is a pretty a standard fee. Maybe a bit expensive, but not shady. I’m going to go along with them and get a better feel for how they handle their estate (which is what the invitation was originally for), and as long as he’s not clearly scamming them or mismanaging their money I won’t push them into something they aren’t comfortable doing.

To address some things people have brought up: I don’t want to or intend to manage my parents money for them, and I’m definitely not going to take charge and dump their retirement into a low cost index fund. I was unfamiliar with how financial advisor fees typically work, and my gut instinct was that this was not normal and my parents might be in trouble. Clearly I was wrong, and I appreciate everyone’s input into the situation.

200k Student Loan Debt Making Slightly under 52K a year.,"Title says it all. I've been meaning to post here for some time, but I saw that someone with a similar amount posted and it pushed it to do it. Long story short, I have a stupid poli sci PhD, and I have a lot of debt that grew from interest since undergrad. I don't blame anyone but myself, but I wish I had parents that were a little tougher on me, but they are immigrants, and really believed in education. Had no idea what I was doing.  I was told, go to XXXXX school, it will pay off in the end. You're more than welcome to call me stupid, because I deserve it. I'm literally on the verge of killing myself over my debt. This is not a joke. This is a bit of a throwaway account due to this.

&amp;#x200B;

I have both federal and private. I am on a rate reduction program with Navient paying around $600 dollars a month. My take home pay is around 1.5K biweekly after everything. I haven't started paying back my federal loans yet. Last year, made only 15K a year working part-time. Now, I have a great job in research administration, working for the state at 52K a year. My coworkers are great and the benefits are amazing, but no way in hell I can pay off this debt with the interest on 52K a year.  I paid off all my credit cards, set up a retirement fund with my job. I moved back with my parents. Do not pay rent, but I offer to pay other expenses when needed. it is not much.  I don't have a car payment, I only pay for gas, as I drive a hand-me-down. I rarely go out to eat, and have been storing money away to start paying back high interest rate loans after I paid off credit cards and put a small emergency fund.  The only expenses I have are gym, pool, and now a boxing class which is the only thing that gives me sanity. The gym is less than 25 dollars a month, the pool is about $100 for the whole year (and I go weekly), the boxing classes will be less than $100 for four months.  I always try to see if I can do something cheaper (i.e. change a logic board on mac and upgrade the OS instead of buying a new computer, learning how to take care of my car myself instead of paying ungodly amounts to a mechanic, etc).  I bring my own lunch, coffee, ect. Doing as much as  I can. Trying to be a little kind to myself seeing that I brought my salary from 17K at a shit job to 52K at a much better place in less than one year. But, the reality is that my job, as great as it is, might not give me much room to grow in the long run. 

&amp;#x200B;

The other option I have is to move to another state that will pay more, but my expenses might be more. Since I'm in political science, DC might be a lot better, but it can get expensive.  Started to teach college classes on the side, but they pay less than 3K per class for the whole semester.  It's a lot of work for little pay, though I love it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about freelancing, but I'm not sure how much I can rake in. Was wondering if anyone here made some decent extra income with freelancing?

I feel like I'm screwed forever to the point I don't want anyone to marry me to carry this burden.  Sorry, but thanks for listening. All I can think of this Christmas is how screwed I am, and I really don't blame anyone but myself as I mentioned. If I ever have kids, I will try to teach them proper financial management.

"26 y/o Freelance Copywriter with Bipolar Disorder I looking to make $10,000 per month","Hello,

I'm a 26-year-old male freelance copywriter.

I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder I with psychosis + anxiety and I'm happy that I finally knew what I was dealing with since I was a child.

I think everything blew out of proportion when I started working. I quit 3 jobs in 4 years (wasn't fired, dunno why) because I was struggling to keep up a good work performance. I was always late and tend to call in sick most of the time. Colleagues tend to bully me or take advantage of me whenever depression's ugly head reveals itself. I looked weak and I know I looked weak.

The pattern is always like this: I'll always start my job strong then I'll plummet into a spiral of work performance issues. Even if the data shows that I was performing well, my colleagues always pick on my constant mistakes—probably triggered by depression.

It killed me. I always wanted to do well at whatever job I'm in, so I decided to become a freelance copywriter instead.

Now, I'm doing better and making more money than before. My monthly income ranges from $1000 to $4000, depending on my mood that month. (If you're thinking, that's too low, that's because I'm from a 3rd world country).

Now, I need to scale up my freelance career and take on another business so I can bump up my income to $10,000 per month. I need that so I can finally buy my own house and the stuff I really need to make my home more bipolar-friendly. I also need it so I can finally get married to my wonderful girlfriend who stuck with me for half a decade through my irrational highs and my contagious lows.

My skills are (In order of proficiency):

1. Writing
2. Direct Response Copywriting
3. Digital Marketing
4. Data Analysis
5. Programming (Python)

I'm thinking of taking on these income-generating activities:

* Stock trading  

   * I'm planning to use my Python skills to help me make better trading decisions. I'll probably have to read a lot of books on technical and fundamental investing + hours of simulated practice before I start doing this.
* Dropshipping  

   * I'm aware of the bad rap about dropshipping concerning customer service, insane delivery times, and razor thin margins, but I figured it will complement well with my present skill set.
* Blogging  

   * I'm thinking of creating niche blogs that would drive revenue from ads then eventually sell them. Later, I plan to buy websites and fix them so I can sell them at a higher price or use them to drive monthly revenues.
* Selling products as an affiliate marketer  

   * Like dropshipping, I think it will complement well with my present skill set.
* Starting my own course  

   * I could teach people how to do digital marketing right or write copy and sell it for at least $100
* Massively selling my copywriting service  

   * I know freelancing is supposed to be managed like an actual business, but I'm thinking of taking it a step further like consistent blogging and other stuff

I'm posting this because I'm not sure if I should take on these activities, considering my disorder, or if there's a better opportunity for people like me with my skill set out there. Anything that can help me achieve my target monthly income goal.

If there's a specific group or forum for questions like this, I'll be happy to join them.

Looking forward to your responses.

Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a9h8cc/26_yo_freelance_copywriter_with_bipolar_disorder/,1545763780,personalfinance

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf

And in the Deductions, Adjustments, and Additional Income Worksheet, line 4 states:

""Enter an estimate of your 2019 adjustments to income, qualified business income deduction, and any additional standard deduction for age or blindness (see Pub. 505 for information about these items).

So I search Pub. 505:

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p505.pdf

and at the bottom of page 8 it clarifies the instructions for this line by detailing some of the deductions and adjustments to income you can make, including HSA contributions.  My question is why are 401(k) contributions not listed?  Shouldn't they also be deducted, especially since HSA contributions are?  Wouldn't this also apply for 529 plan contributions?  I figured maybe it's just omitted from the instructions, but it would still be correct to deduct 401(k) contributions, so that if I were planning on maxing out 401k ($19k) and family HSA contribution ($7k), then my line 4 in this worksheet would be $26k.

First steps of a will&amp; trust for new parents with no networth,"merry Christmas &amp; Happy holidays all. just spending a nice relaxing and quiet day with our newborn baby in **NJ**

I'm going to try and keep it light- hopefully other new parents can gain info from this. 

I've done some light googling and reddit-searching but haven't found anything that pertains to my situation enough for me to get a good understanding of what to do. there's always those very long, detailed posts that are carefully put together and really hit it home for a lot of folks learning about PF. I've read a few but alot are very detailed and moreso financial based, whereas were looking more along the lines of BOTH parents passing in this case. it would be irresponsible to not have some things set up to make sure your kids aren't left for relatives and courts to fight. 

[**What do new parents need to do to make sure their babies are taken care of if something were to happen to both parents**

some pertinent facts I think:

no assets, almost zero net worth between us. we've already added each other to the savings accounts so they can be liquidated immediately if other parent dies. we have one person who we'd like to have access to these if we both die and he can appropriately apply this money to baby's immediate or future needs.

one grandma of the baby does(will) babysit on a daily basis and has the means to take care of baby if both parents die. (retired, financial stability, and mentally sound) we'd like for her to get custody but also want to make sure no other close family members get blocked from baby's life. probably wouldn't be an issue but would like this fact protected.

I know this should've been done during pregnancy but we will get 20 year life insurance policies on the household earner father and maybe a smaller one on lower- income mommy. (500k+/100k respectively??)  what if we both die, we'd appropriate these funds to same person as above to apply them towards baby's life as he sees fit. 




are we looking for an estate planning attorneys? do we simply need a will? 

I understand my states rules and how-tos for filing wills but how far can your demands really go? also learned the differences between beneficiaries vs being named in a will. example the life insurance beneficiaries will be each other, and then the person we both trust to use the funds appropriately if neither of us are here to do so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a9heok/first_steps_of_a_will_trust_for_new_parents_with/,1545765083,personalfinance

"Great Great Aunt needs to be placed into assisted living, doesn’t have enough money to last more than a year","My great aunt is 95 and is recovering from a fall in the hospital. Her mind is still very sharp, but she’s very weak so the hospital won’t release her to live with her son. She needs to move into assisted living but money is an issue.

Even with the discount, she doesn’t have enough saved to be able to pay for it longer than a year. From what we understand, Medicaid doesn’t kick in until she’s lived in the assisted living home for two years.

"Help! Taking over my disabled dad's finances, how to start???","Hello all, my dad is mentally disabled and horrible with finances.  He's on a fixed income but got a substantial settlement in Septmeber, around 30K, and blew it all in two months. In one week in October he spent over three thousand dollars. 

Two days ago he finally let me start the process to become his primary caretaker and I'm excited to start handling his finances for him.  He came clean to me these last few days about a lot of credit card debt that I didn't know about and that he has been throwing away all the mail and information about. He also hasn't paid taxes in three years and has few little paperwork about those years.  Besides all that, there are two houses and two cars to pay towards, and he's unsure about how much his bills are on anything.  I'm scouring old bank records to try to figure out patterns to his bills and to create a basic monthly budget, but it's hard going.  I should add, I'm a 21 year old college student on scholarship, with him as my dad, so my financial literacy is basically nil. 

Where do I start in getting control of his finances? 

Have any of you had to help a family member out in this way?  

How do I find out what he might owe if I don't have any paperwork? 

What's a good way to start a budget and savings and all that jazz?

"Is a $60,000 car too much for a $166,000 income?","Hello all,

My wife and I are getting a new car. Well, used, but new to us. Bottom line is that I want a car that we will say costs roughly $60,000 (rounding up). Together we make $166,000 per year before taxes. After taxes is about $120,000. We live in the Southern US, and have a low cost of living. We have no children and currently rent an apartment ($900 per month).

Currently, the only debt we have is for another car, we owe about $19,000 left on it (from the loan when we bought it). This fall we finished paying off the last of our college loans (about $70,000).  We have no credit card debt besides what we spend each month. Both of our credit scores are about 800. We are mid-20s professionals.

We currently max out both our IRAs. We contribute every month to our employer matched 401ks. We are saving about $25k per year towards retirement. We have about $45k in savings right now (we started saving about 2 years ago). 

Now that we have paid off our college loans (we were very aggressive about that), and we are saving for retirement at a good rate, we have new goals. The big one is saving for a house. Looking at our budget, I see that we are more than able to save for a house AND get the car that I want. 

My wife feels that this is too much. I love cars and have been dreaming about this day for a long time. We have paid our loans, we are doing well for ourselves (our financial stability is all but guaranteed, or as close as one can reasonably get to that), and we can still save for a house, retirement, AND the car that I want. I should also mention it isn't anything crazy. It is a luxury SUV that I believe will be reliable and a car we keep for 10+ years. 

I know that r/personalfinance leans toward the ""get the cheapest car that will work and get you to your destination"". My question is more along the lines of ""is this too crazy?""

I follow the 10/10/4 rule or whatever you want to call it. You put 10-20% down on the car, you only spend 10% of your pre-tax income on your vehicle, (including taxes, insurance, gas, etc), and you keep your loan to 4 years. For the two of us, and therefore two cars, $166,000 comes to $32,000 per year so $120,000 over four years for two cars. Take away the $25,000 for her car, $10,000 for insurance and gas, and you still have plenty left. Bottom line is that $60,000 for our income seems more that doable. Yes you can always save and go cheaper. But cars are important to me and I have been dreaming of this. Hence the question being about whether or not this is crazy or not, as opposed to whether we should save more.

What do you think? Am I crazy? Full transparency I will crosspost this to r/cars because I'm curious for their take as well.

"3 questions: 401(k), HSA, Wash Sale Rule","Hi All,

I’ve had no problem doing my own taxes for a long time as a single filer but this year has been odd. I’m hoping I get some answers for these 3 situational questions:

1. I switched jobs mid-year and new my company did percentage based 401k contributions. They ended up contributing $5k extra based on bonuses. So I know I have to request additional contribution withdrawal before April 15th but given the correction in the last 2 months - which account should I get the money back from? The 401k early in the year or the new one that’s been losing money? Secondly, I would have to pay if I earned interest on the money but I’ve lost money (28%) in both accounts on this calendar year. How do I go about that? (I assume just take out the money and not claim loses?)

2. Same context about switching jobs. I, also, had $2-3k additional contributed to HSA. Already withdrew the additional contributions and plan on listing the income separately during tax season...but does it make sense to hire a tax accountant to assist in doing it right the first time?

3. I ran into some technical stuff where I wanted to schedule a sale and then purchase 32 days apart between 2 separate accounts but had a mental lapse. I ended up doing a sale on Day 1, purchase on same Day 1 (separate account), not realizing it and then a sale on Day 13. I ended up losing $4k on the first sale and gaining $19k on the second sale. How does the wash sale rule impact the net $15k (+ other loses on same ticker earlier in the year)?

Why has no one made a good piece of personal finance software?,"Every 3 months or so I convince myself to run through all the personal finance softwares and am always blown away by how terrible they are.

&amp;#x200B;

Mint:

\- Can make rules, but they are oversimplified. You can't seem to make them from scratch, and if your transaction is already wrong based on the Mint defaults you get into situations where the rule you make to fix something ends up breaking other things...  
\- Can't tell the difference between [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Amazon Fresh, and my wife getting a paycheck from Amazon  
\- Best connection with banks so far  
\- UI and charting functionality doesn't seem to have gotten new features in 10+ years

&amp;#x200B;

YNAB:  
\- Forces you into a single mindset of money, which often doesn't make sense with long term savings being placed into different accounts  
\- Can't make rules, even for basic categorization  
\- Can't tell the difference between [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Amazon Fresh, and my wife working at Amazon. I attempted to create a new payee to tell the difference between groceries and Christmas gifts, and it turned everything into groceries. There seems to be no way to fix their very broken auto-payee logic  
\- Can't bulk rename payees?  
\- Online interface, which ends up being super frustrating. Rename a payee, press tab. Forgets what you typed and you have to go through the process of creating a new payee, instead of it just realizing that's what you did.

&amp;#x200B;

Quicken for Mac:

\- Can't make rules

&amp;#x200B;

Personal Capital:

\- Over indexed on investments  
\- Cant make rules  
\- Always losing connection with banks

&amp;#x200B;

PocketSmith:

\- This has been the closest I've come to a functional piece of software  
\- Constantly was losing connection to my accounts, so I spent more time fixing those than doing any budgeting or analysis  


Trim:

\- Seems overly simplistic based on what I've seen  
\- Until recently the only option was signing up through Facebook, which seems like a huge red flag

&amp;#x200B;

All I really want is a software that is reliable to let me view my spending. It should let me set up rules to tell the difference between Amazon Fresh, [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com), Amazon Prime Video etc. This is a simple example based on a single company, but this type of thing seems to happen all the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

If payee contains ""Amazon Fresh"" set payee to ""Amazon Fresh"" and set category to ""Groceries""

If payee contains ""Mary's Place"" set payee to ""Mary's Place"" and set category to ""Charitable Donations"".

&amp;#x200B;

Use some basic metadata to set the right payee and right category. I'm not even asking that complicated of questions. Things like ""how much did I spent on this payee each month for the last year.""

Company overpaid me months ago and still hasn't cashed the check returning it with 12/31 days away. Am I liable for taxes on unearned income?,"Hello Personal Finance,

I posted a few months ago about having been given a paycheck for hours I did not work and after speaking with the payroll people it was agreed that I would send in a check to them and they would sort everything out. Now for a little context, I worked for an absurdly rich individual who has their own family office for expenses and a payroll service that I was paid through for work I did over the summer. As I said before, I got a paycheck from them for just over a thousand dollars (literally pennies for my boss but big money for me as a college student) and I gave the office a check for the amount back in September. After requesting that they cash it so it is in their control instead of staying in my register they have left it open for the entire fall. 

If they don't cash it by 12/31, what will happen? Will I be recorded as having made the extra thousand and taxed on it? Is it mine in any arguable way? Any help or advice would be appreciated. 

I have made many requests for it to be cashed and to ask what the status is and the only information I have gotten is that the payroll people are having a hard time changing their books about me being paid or something to that effect.

are the sacrifices necessary to become a net worth millinaire at a younger age worth it?,"First of all, Merry XMAS!!

&amp;#x200B;

Ive been  reading alot of finance blogs and advice columns on how to generate wealth and pay off debt, using strategies such as renting out your spare bedroom, eating out less, picking the right investments, earning more money in your career etc etc

&amp;#x200B;

I realized that I can probably make myself a ""millionaire"" by age 42-45, in terms of assets - debts, if I stick to all these various strategies. 

&amp;#x200B;

but these strategies involve sacrifice.  I'm refusing vacations. I'm occasionally spending more time making home cooked meals for longer stretches in order to put more money towards investments/debts (and one of my favorite things to do is to check out new restaurants). I spent probably 10-12 weekends in 2018 renovating my and figuring out repairs myself because I did not want to throw money at hiring someone. obviously, my social life suffered and there were periods where I wondered ""what the hell I am doing?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the reason why is is frusrrating is because it is self imposed. I can EASILY afford to do the other things I want, but I Am choosing to increase my weatlth instead, which involves me living like someone who has a third of my salary at times. 

&amp;#x200B;

so Im wondering, is it worth it? will I reach 43-45 (12 years down the line for me), and think ""YES! Im so happy I ate beans and rice for a week straight, didnt take the vacation overseas, etc etc"".

"""Found"" lots of land/forest in our possession. What to do?","Hi, so it turns out, that my girlfriend's parents have acres of forests in Serbia and Croatia.

I remember recently reading, that forests are pretty good investments in times bad times for financial markets (as they grow 5% a year). Those forests have been growing for about 30 years at least and seem to at least partially consist of oaks, or so they think.

Two questions arise:

1) What should we do with that land? We don't need short-term money and have some money we could invest if the ROI is alright. I thought about clearing everything and reforesting it. However, I have no experience with wood at all. I know some people who are carpenters and one that is a pretty large office furniture producer, but I'm not sure this is helping me. How do I find people who do the work, transporting and who buy the wood from me? I don't know about the mentality there, but according to my girlfriend's stories I'd rather have someone whos not a local there...  Are there any alternatives to reforesting everything that I haven't thought of? Selling the land or building there probably won't be very profitable.

&amp;#x200B;

2) It seems there are some problems with the Croatian land register due to their EU entry currently. The land is certainly owned by my girlfriends family, but they told them that in the land register it is still listed as owned by a community from the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. They said it's going to be fixed within the next years. Does anyone know where I can read up on this? And how to accelerate this?

How are tax brackets affected by 401K &amp; IRA contributions for 2018? [US - California],"Can someone help explain how 401k &amp; IRA contributions affect your tax bracket for the 2018 year?

&amp;#x200B;

**Example**

Income: **90k**

401k Contributions: **10k**

IRA Contributions: **5.5k**

Does this make my taxable income **74.5k?** And therefore part of the 22% Fed Income Tax bracket?

Making Use of Good Credit?,"After many years of casually using a very basic Wells Fargo credit card ($2K credit limit, 1% cash back, no fees), my Equifax score has just passed excellent (760) and my TransUnion score is nearly there (749).  I figure it's high time I get an upgrade.  I could do a lot better with cash back, for starters, but I imagine there may be other ways to leverage my credit score as well that I'm not aware of.

I've been using CreditKarma to see some credit card offerings, but I know, just given the sponsored nature of their website, I'm not seeing all there is.  So, for someone with around a ~750 credit score, what am I missing out on, and what should be in my wallet right now?

I am an uninsured driver who damaged my friend's car,"Throwaway account. I'm hoping it is ok to ask for this kind of advice here.

I damaged my friend's car a while back, minor, only to their car. The door is scratched and dented and there are some minor nicks extending into three other panels but these are a lot less visible.

My friend said they went to a body shop and was quoted $2-2.5k for repairs.

My friend says it's because of the pearl paint, but it's only a mid 2010s Camry so 2.5k is a sizeable portion of the value of the vehicle.

I can't afford $2k for repairs. We are both college students, and the car belongs to their parents. I was driving it because my friend asked me to pick them up.

My friend said there's a way for their insurance to cover it and I would just pay their deductible, but they need my license.

Right now I am trying to figure out what their insurance is going to do with my license and since I do not have a policy myself, I'm worried their insurance is going to come after me.

Is this something to be worried about? Will I get points on my license or will their insurance send collections after me? Has anyone dealt with this before?

Child charged $1800 to aunt's credit card,"Aunt (N) recently was in the hospital for a week. She is legally blind and relies on other friends and family members to help with anything technically related.

She in no way can afford this. I told her to call her CC company and file a dispute that she did NOT authorize these charges in any way. I feel that the CC company would go along with that?

Bay Area: Buy a house pre or post-IPO,"My wife are in our mid 30's and our finances just turned around in a big way. We're maxing out our 401(k) but the base cash we're making now is almost twice what we made just two years ago. We are in the Bay Area and want to know if it's time to buy and, if so, how to best approach it. It feels like we're at the top of the market-- we want to have a house to live in-- but don't want it to be a poorly considered purchase. All housing options are open as we're both handy (previously done construction, electrical, plumbing, etc).

Available down payment/closing: $150k

Combined base: $300k

Typical cash bonus: $50k

Vested RSU per year: $275-650k

Typical monthly spending: -$5000 (includes all recurring monthly or annual commitments) Rent is $3600 today.

We're counting vested RSUs and cash bonus as $0 for the annual income --because it isn't guaranteed-- though we do anticipate additional cash once the RSUs become liquid next year (fingers crossed). That would suggest a home around $1.1M would be comfortable on current cash flow. Let's assume we find a home we would be happy with at $1.1M.

* What type of loan makes sense if we anticipate great increases in annual cash? ARM or fixed? What about a 5/1 no-money down at 5%? Normally, I'd hope for better returns than 5% in the stock market but that's not looking likely the next year.
* Can we do a group loan for a TIC with friends and buy a duplex together? Many houses here are duplexes anyways and we'd rather share the building with someone we know. This should drop $/sq-ft dramatically.
* Are there special requirements for setting up a TIC or restrictions on a mortgage for such?
* Is it good to buy now before the stock is liquid or better to wait for when our purchasing power is greater but there is much more competition in the marketplace? With Uber, Lyft, and AirBnB going public next year, there will probably be plenty of extra cash floating around the market.
* Should we just continue saving cash while riding the market upheaval?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a9j0ap/bay_area_buy_a_house_pre_or_postipo/,1545777491,personalfinance

I have a chronic illness. What’s the best way to save for future expenses?,"Hi, everyone. On-and-off lurker and first time poster, here.

I’m 28F, and I have a chronic illness (endometriosis, if you’re curious.) I’d like to get advice on the best way to save for future expected medical expenses. Here are the fast facts:

- My disease is progressive, but it won’t kill or (probably) disable me.
- Patients with my disease can expect outpatient surgery every two or so years, along with basic care like doctor visits, prescriptions, tests, etc.
- If you’re familiar with the disease, you might know it causes infertility. I’m not looking to have kids, so no need for advice on saving for fertility treatments.
- I have decent health insurance through my employer. It’s an open access plan (OAP). It does not offer an HSA, but I do have an FSA.
- I am building up my emergency savings through a savings account. There is currently about $2,000 in there, and it has an interest rate of 2%.
- Yes, I have student loans, but no credit card debt.

Leaving a job for lower paying one that might have more to do?,"I am conflicted because with the higher paying job, I spend almost 5-6 hours doing nothing sometimes and the extra work they have for me is sending out emails which is blah. I find myself applying to other jobs and reading in my spare time with this job.

=====================================

Pros of staying with Job #1: Higher pay than the other one most likely. I will have stayed with 6+ months if I decline job #2. I decided recently that I want to self study programming/data analytics for 1-1.5 year or so and because of how easy going this job is, this job would give me more time for me to study. Coworkers are nice and noone to micromanage me. It might be more technical than the sales job.

Cons of Job #1: Sometimes 5-6 hours of me not doing anything...just me guiding people through how to use our product. Close to me hitting my learning threshold with this job. Expected to always be 'on' even when there are no customers calling in. (Customer Service). There is no guarantee that I'll have the discipline to follow through with my self study...Not really in the field I want to be in.

======================================


Job #2 Pros: I will ikely be more active on this job.

Vanguard 529 plans - no reinvestment of earnings/dividends?,"Hello,

I have a Vanguard 529 plan and reviewed the investment options. All of them end in ""Portfolio"" and after investigating some of the options, it does not appear that there are reinvestments of earnings/dividends. For example, the ""[Vanguard Growth Index Portfolio](https://investor.vanguard.com/529-plan/profile/4517)"" does not have a ""Distributions"" tab. However, 100% of this portfolio is allocated to [Vanguard Growth Index Fund Institutional Shares (VIGIX)](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/distributions/vigix) which does have a Distributions tab and therefore dividends. 

My goal in a 529 plan is to reinvest earnings/dividends, but it appears Portfolios in Vanguard's 529 plans do not allow this. Does anyone know if there are Portfolios with reinvestment options? Also are 529 plans (anybody's, not just Vanguard's) not able to reinvest dividends and earnings?

I'm 27 years old, and I make about 4,600 per month after taxes. I have my monthly car payment of $300, and that's pretty much my only essential expense as of now. No other debt. I still live with my parents working full time job. I have about 4K in my savings account (paid off my student loans few months ago).

When do you determine you can move out and live comfortably (i.e. not worry about bills and afford to go on vacation once or twice in a year)?

I am freaking out over my fiancee's $140K in student loans and she doesn't seem worried,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

She(27F) is finishing law school in a few months. I(25M) am a software engineer (temp not working, soon to change).

She has 2 student loans: 
- $40k at 5.5% 
- $100k at 1% (from a family member) 
She spends about $1.5K/mo 
I spend about $700/mo 
Our mortgage on our 1 bedroom place is $2k (we live in a major US city in a condo together) 
She doesn't have a job lined up, but she will likely take a job that pays about $70k/yr. 

I'm worried that she doesn't realize 2 things: (1) the levity of her debt and (2) the difference that decreasing spending can make. I don't know if $1.5k in spending a month is a lot, but she wants to go on a trip to this summer that will likely cost $6k ish and she buys her clothes at Nordstrom.

The whole situation gives me a lot of anxiety (mostly what I feel is her frivolous spending and apparent lack of understanding of the levity of her situation).

Wash sale definition question,"If I buy a security on one day and sell it the following day for a loss, does that trigger a wash sale? As a follow-on question, does it matter if I own any other lots in that security at the time of the sale?

Investopedia and other sources say: ""The wash-sale rule is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation established to disallow a tax deduction for a security sold in a wash sale. The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a “substantially identical” stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so.""

It seems like the answer given this is ""yes, the original premise would result in a wash sale"", but I'm having a hard time verifying this. It also seems a little strange, because it implies that you can't ever realize a loss in a security within 30 days of buying it. Does anyone have experience with this?

My Mom Lost over 10K Trading Options... How to fix this,"I told her that the secret is buying diversified funds and holding onto them, but she saw a coworker trading options and secretly started trading them. I don't fully understand options trading and ***neither does she***. That's what so hurtful about this, is she could go into something so woefully unprepared without consulting me. We sold them all at a huge loss so that we can take advantage of tax selling, and I reinvested what was left in VTI. So, the question is, how can we fix this? I've convinced her to put a substantial amount of money in a 5 year CD with a good rate. She told me that she wouldn't need to access the money these next 5 years and she's turning 60 soon, so I imagine she'll be able to access her IRA within the next year (someone correct me if I'm wrong). But we lost 14k. I'd like to know what's a good benchmark for us to aim to earn to replace this, when factoring future value and things of that nature. I'm still so shocked. She told me she lost some money on investments but I didn't know the full extent until yesterday.

Gold mastercard:

interest rate of 9.9% annual fee of $50 includes choice rewards.

Classic mastercard:

interest rate of 11.9% and annual fee of $30.

Cashback mastercard:

interest rate of 19.9% no annual fee, with choice rewards.

"I want to maximize the use of my credit card, How would I do that?","Background story you can skip:
A little less than a year ago, I got a credit card because I had encountered a situation where I lost my wallet traveling for work, without enough gas to make it to where I was going or get back home, it took a lot of fenangeling but I managed to get access to my money and made it through the week. Got my card replaced and got a credit card to store in my car for incase such things happen again (have used it since when forgetting my wallet at home, etc. It was like a backup debit card)

Important stuff:
As I said above, I travel for work a lot, and my company allows me to expense certain things (like food, tools, etc). So I started using my credit card when some financial things started to get a little tight in the budget area, since all that money is coming right back to me anyways. 
I remember when I got the card through my bank (It's a Chase Freedom card) they told me that the best way to build credit with it was to leave a balance of 20% of my card's max over, after making at least the minimum payment. Problem is, I have absolutely NO idea how qualified these people are to be giving me advice. looking it up online, no one seems to have solid advice, the best I seem to be able to get is ""I don't know, keep it under 30%, probably"" and asking people just gets me ""BE SCARED OF CREDIT CARDS THEY WILL RUIN YOU!"" and that's not helpful at all.

Help me with what to do with a lot of money.,"I don't really know how else to put it out there but with that title.

​

Long story short - I'm brokering a deal between a buying party and a producing party for a very in-vogue chemical. Seller has agreed to my commissions to be paid out of escrow when the deal is done. I will be walking into over a million dollars alone in just one of the spot-buy's. There is the very real possibility of this paying out more than just a few million by the end of the year (2019, not this year)

​

What the hell does one do with this money? I will be getting my LLC and business bank account set up for the escrow to dump into, but other than that, I'm 100% in the dark here. I really don't wanna get owned on taxes, thus not putting it into my personal accounts, but even that I'm unsure of... I am not a huge spender (my job already nets me a pretty damn comfortable living) but obviously, if this much money is coming in, I will be spending a few thousand to pay off some odd credit cards --  other than that, I'm not interested in spending the money currently and looking for the best way to move from here. 

​

Any advice? I know this sounds insane, but I need to start addressing it as a reality because all the paperwork is signed and next week I'm flying with the buyer(s) to inspect the product at the lab before shipping.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8fxzz/help_me_with_what_to_do_with_a_lot_of_money/,1545437388,personalfinance
Is Bankruptcy a good choice for me in my current financial state?,"I'll start off by stating that I definitely recognize I've made some big financial mistakes when I was younger and I was never able to really pay attention to them because of the severe lack of funds I had at the time. If I could go back and kick myself I would. Fast forward to now.  I've had a steady decent job for about 10 months for the first time in my life.  I've been trying to save a little.  I was approached by my HR manager saying that someone called to verify I worked there.  She let me know it was likely to garnish my wages and told me to reach out them and try and resolve the issue externally if I could.  I called the debt management company, set up a payment plan of 200 dollars a month(the debt totaled out to 15,000, I believe it's an outstanding balance for a school I attended briefly), and thought I'd taken care of everything.  

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was served a very sudden notice of wage garnishment (which will take effect starting next month for another 11,000) from a completely different company.  I had a car repossessed close to six years ago and I can't think of anything else this could be. I've not really gotten any notice from either of these two companies prior to this, but obviously it comes as a pretty big surprise to me.  This is sort of compounded by the fact that last month I was diagnosed with Cancer, and have racked up close to 5,500.00 in medical bills in the last month.  I'm strongly considering bankruptcy.  

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a breakdown of my finances:

Monthly income after tax: 2450.00 (before garnishment)

Current savings: 1100.00

&amp;#x200B;

Monthly expenses:1960.00 (including 200.00 for first debt repayment):

\-car payment 275.00

\-Insurance 200.00

\-Rent 850.00 (including utilities)

\-Debt repayment to first company 200.00

\-internet 40.00

\-Gym 40.00

\- Groceries, cat food, netflix, gas, etc.: 355.00ish 

&amp;#x200B;

Current Debt:

Student Loans: 77,000.00  (I have not started paying these back yet, on temporary forbearance)

Unsecured Debt: 31,000.00 

Auto loan: 13,000.00

Medical Bills: 5,200.00

&amp;#x200B;

I was informed that the amount that would be taken from my wages is 374.00.  It would reduce my bi-weekly pay to somewhere around 876 a month.  I will have to start paying my medical bills here very soon, as well as my student loans. I'm kind of losing it over here.  I don't really know anyone that would co-sign a debt consolidation loan for me, are there other options?  Or does it just make sense to push forward with filing a bankruptcy? Thanks in advance for any advice everyone..

Need help/reassurance that I’m calculating a potential paycheck right.,"I have an offer to relocate to Denver, CO with a 78k salary. For tax purposes I am single with no real tax deductions.

Salary: 78k

Colorado state tax(4.65%): $3611

Federal taxes: $4542+($38524*.22)=$13018

Social security (7.65%): $5967

Weekly paycheck:$1065

I understand that the first 12k of my salary is a federal tax deduction so that’ll be lower, but I figured if I ignore this it’ll compensate for the extra taxes they’ll take out.

Gunshy after losing home in the last recession - to buy in 2019 or wait a bit longer?,"We lost our asses a few years ago and are about to come up on our 4 year cool down period after short selling our house. Among the things we learned is listening to warning alarms in our minds. Right now mine are blaring. Interest rates are going up, the stock market is not doing well, rents have fallen in our area by 15%, and home prices are higher than I feel they should be. Additionally, buying a home in Illinois doesn't seem optimal due to our state budget dumpster fire (though we don't want to live in another state--another country, yes, but not really another state).

Current personal finance situation is a small remaining student loan debt and a small car payment balance, both of which could be paid off with the money we have saved for a down payment on the condo we rent. Our landlord will be selling it in 2019 and he has made us a fair written offer, but we are not obligated to accept it. Condos are also a slightly different animal for mortgages. Even with a 750 credit score post-short sale, the best fixed rate we can find with 0 points is 5.125% and 4.5% with 2 points. ARMs aren't much better than the 0 point option. We'd have to do conventional as the building isn't FHA approved due to a zero renting policy enacted several years ago. Our landlord is grandfathered in.

&amp;#x200B;

Are we simply being overly cautious or is there cause to hesitate? We've been living here since the house sold and it is more than adequate, we prefer it over a single family house, but we can rent cheaper than the condo mortgage+HOA+tax. We can also pay off those two debts, bank a bunch of cash while renting, then take advantage of a downturned housing market I suppose. Had we timed it right, we could've bought a condo here for $90k instead of $140k a few years later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8g12n/gunshy_after_losing_home_in_the_last_recession_to/,1545437981,personalfinance

"After years of refunds, I owe $7,000 in federal taxes this year due to the tax law changes and not changing my withholding","I've preliminarily done my '18 taxes and after getting at least a bit of a refund for years and years, I will owe close to $7,000 this year.

I had run some numbers and assumed the reduction in rates would somewhat offset the SALT cap, but not even close.

I did not change my W4 withholding like I should have.  The updated W4 worksheet should be used to re-figure out your allowances especially if you are in a high tax state like CA or NY and earn a six figure salary.

I just updated mine and went from 8 allowances to 0, based on the new guidance.

Hopefully next year I will come out around even but this was a big shocker.

Please be aware these 'tax cuts' may raise your taxes significantly!

Lost 60% in the stock market; help please!,"**TL:DR: Down to $6k from $15k leveraged; need $5k in 5 months; job lined up after 6 months **

Hi guys, I'm a current undergraduate senior in the US. Have been investing for 2+ years now (mostly on Robinhood); made a lot of great returns the past few years before this recent crash. Unfortunately now through a combination of me not diversifying out of tech and stupidly leveraging my money away, I am now down 50-60%, from a peak of ~$15,000 to about $6000 now. At my peak stupidity I had $15k + $12k leveraging for a total of about $27k in investments, mostly all in blue chip tech and tech ETFs. (I know). 

I have sold some shares but am still leveraging $6000 to try to make back some of the losses ( so still have $12k invested currently) but am getting very spooked. I have weathered multiple losses of up to 30-35% before and always recovered for the better; however 50-60% losses are where I started getting very worried.  

I am looking for more of a long term investment but had been counting on having at least $5k around in in May/June to be able to travel after graduation. I do however have a well-paying job lined up in July from which I am aiming to save many multiples of my current investments. So it would not be the end of the world if I spent all my investments by July, but certainly not ideal. 

I realize that the market rewards patience and certainly will recover long-term — but I will definitely need the $5k in about 5 months. This is my conundrum — for this situation, should I pull everything out? Try to buy up more shares at this price? Just hold on for 5 months? I would greatly appreciate input; thank you!

**Edit: To clarify, I only lost most of my gains; most (~85%) of the principal I put in is untouched. Before the market crash I was up ~100-110% in two years. **",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8ga0s/lost_60_in_the_stock_market_help_please/,1545439910,personalfinance

Cousin needs help,"Here's my cousin's income:  He gets SSI, he's 34 years old, and he works a few seasonal, part time jobs.  He gets 1.3K from all of his sources of income.   He recently earned his associate's degree in IT support, and he has IT skills, however, due to his disability, he's struggled to find a job in his field due to his interview skills.     He's taken an A+ and N+ prep course and his mom has control over his bank account. 10 is going towards buying a mobile home in the woods, and the other 10 is what he calls ""bug out money"", in case he loses his benefits or his jobs.       

He sees the writing on the wall when it comes to living off the government.  He's not going to be able to live off of it and have a meaningful existence, and he wants to have a career, and possibly a family.   He's talented and hard working, BUT he also has autism, which makes social interaction difficult.     I want to make sure he has the right help and he makes the right financial decisions.   

Do you think the upcoming bear market might affect his chances of being able to get a job in his field?  Do you think he should even make a purchase of a mobile home at this time?   Or should he wait until the recession starts to go out and buy one then start his career. He's exhausted his trial work periods, and he won't be able to restart it until next year.    

So should he wait until next year or should he simply get his foot in the door now with a part time job, and then move up?  Should he move from where he's living right now?  He pays 500$ a month in rent in a rough neighborhood.  Should he invest in commodities?    I want what's best for this dude.  

And dude, this guy is awesome.  He managed to eat nothing but generic Campbell's soup so he could save up enough money for a car.

College Student Loans,"I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to get student loans even though I’m in college. I currently have the BOG so tuition is essentially free for me. I need to move out of my parents home.

2.	I don’t feel that safe anymore because he blames everything that goes bad in his life on my mother and I. He already threatens her life but doesn’t do the same to me. However I feel his hatred and he’s already talking about how I’m a burden in his life even though he doesn’t pay for any of my shit including rent. My mom works two jobs and pays for all the bills. 
3.	I currently have a 30hr/week job and do online classes full time so it’s definitely doable while saving 75% of my income towards moving out. 
4.	I was thinking of getting Federal loans as I can pay 80% of rent with my current job if I live with 2 other people. Private loans are harder bc my mother doesn’t approve of me getting them or moving out. 
5.	Despite that, they both fucked up their transcripts for my fafsa so I have to amend their taxes to get full financial aid. I’ve been too nervous and unsure to turn it in to the IRS. what if they reject it? The deadline is April 25th to get a student loan. 
6.	Now I’m thinking should I just not and continue to save up money and instead move out next year when I’ll start having lab classes that can’t be done online. 
7.	I’m currently so tired at home; I have no social life or hobbies anymore since my school is about 30minutes away. I picked it specifically bc I thought I’d be out by now and he wouldn’t have as much contact with me. Therefore it’s hard to even form friendships at school and I want to be more involved with the campus.

I can also open a Chase savings account and net $300 if I park $25,000 there for 3 months.  The APY is garbage though.  Is it okay to open an account just for the payoff and then close it and move the funds to an AmEx savings account?  Any hassles or credit rating implications I should be aware of if I do that?

Car troubles.... Mechanic ethics question...,"Hope this is the right place for this. This may be a bit long in the tooth so I appreciate anyone reading this and offering any advice.

So I drive a 2000 MBZ CLK430 that I have had since 2009. It is paid off and I haven't had a car payment since 2013 which is great. Problem is  that I have had to dump a lot of money into the car over the years but all in all the vehicle has treated me well. Recently I had a transmission issue which was causing my gears to slip and it turned out to be a leak. Brought it to a mechanic and they ""fixed"" it and charged me $280 for the work. All is fine for a couple months but around month 3 the transmission starts to slip again. In the midst of the gears slipping, I also had a check engine light come on. Now of course its right around the time that I need to renew my registration and need a smog before I can do that. Took my car back to the mechanic to have him take a look and he said that the seal they used for the transmission wasn't the right size and he would replace it for me at no cost. He couldn't do it that day and wanted me to bring it in the next week but he turned off my check engine light in the meantime. I took my car to get smogged a few days later hoping it would just pass which of course it didn't. Fast forward a week, and I bring my car in and have them fix the seal for the transmission and I also wanted him to source the issue with the smog failure. Full disclosure, I have gone to this mechanic for years and he has always taken care of me so I have no issues with his ethics however, before I leave my car with him to do the work, I explicitly tell him, ""Please call me before you do any work that will cost me money."" He very nonchalantly says ""Don't worry about it, it might be $20 or $30 bucks for the seal."" I say ok and leave. Fast forward again 3 weeks and I still don't have my car. I call him a few times overt those weeks and he tells me it isn't ready and smog is still not passing but they are working on it. Smart me would have asked at this point if he were charging me but I bit my tongue because I needed the work done. So finally on this third week he calls and says the car is ready and to come pick it up. I rush to the shop and go to get my keys and again very nonchalantly he says ""That'll be '7 flat.'"" I ask him ""7 what"" and he says $700!! I tell the guy ""I told you to call me before you did any work where I would get charged and that I didnt have it now."" He said ""Dont worry about it brother just get it to me when you can."" I never received an invoice prior to the work, nor did he inform me of the charges before doing the work and now I am left with a $700 bill. I would've almost contemplated dumping the car because I have put so much money into it but now I am stuck with the bill. My question is, is this ethical? I fully intend to pay him because my car is now fixed, however am I under any strict deadline to pay him right away? He did let me leave with the car without paying a dime and didn't hold it hostage but now I am at a crossroads because I don't have the $700 now and want to do the right thing. Any advice or help on the issue would go a long way!

Need help choosing 401k matching option,"EDIT: I know what I want to do now. Thank you all! :)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Hi everyone! I just my first job and I'm trying to figure out what is the best option for 401k matching.

My employer gives two options. They'll match the larger of the two options:

(a) 100% of contributions up to $3,000

(b) 50% of contributions up to the maximum of $9,000 per calendar year.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep hearing that I need to max out my contributions to get the best match, but I am unsure what the best match is.So would it mean I should elect for B because they'll give me $9,000 in free money (even though I need to contribute $18000) because $9000 is larger than $3000?Or I should do A because the additional $15000 amount I need to contribute if I do A versus B ($18000-$3000 = $15000) would be best sitting and growing in an investment account that would grow more than the ""free money"" I get when I retire at N years from now? Just by thinking this through, I feel that there's maybe a formula that would optimize this situation

Compounding interest,"Hello and good day!
I recently opened a savings account and was told that the interest is compounded daily. Can someone explain to me what that exactly means? I was explained to over the phone by a customer representative but I still don’t really understand. Is the interest compounded on the total amount every day? Is there any interest compounded on my deposits? 
Also I was curious since interest is compounded daily, would it be more advantageous to me to deposit daily instead of once a month? For example, say I was going to deposit $100 every month. Would the daily compounded interest be used more as an advantage if I deposited $3 a day? If I did $3/ day vs $100/ month with a 2.00% apy will one gain more from interest than the other? Thanks in advance for all the responses and helping me out!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8h1tp/compounding_interest/,1545446197,personalfinance
"At one year on the job I will get a bonus and 401k matching, how do I take full advantage?","I read all the beginner steps for a 24yo: keep track of your budget and expenses, start an emergency fund, start saving for retirement, etc. I have a very detailed spreadsheet of my income and expenses but I need help taking it a step further.

I am approaching one year at my current SaaS sales job in February. I pay my rent/utilities, insurance, car loan, and my student loan every month, but I’ve spent most the remaining money on trips, concerts, my expensive girlfriend, and other fun experiences so I’m left with not much in savings. When I reach my one year mark, I will receive a bonus of $4k (expecting between 2600-2800 after taxes).

I will have a savings account of about $1000 when I get that bonus, and I want to grow that as my emergency fund to about $10k eventually.

At my one year mark my company will also start matching up to 3% of my salary to a 401k if I contribute 6%, so I definitely want to take advantage of that.

My question is: how should I use the money from my bonus and in the future how much should I contribute to a 401k vs my savings account as a 24yo?

I also want to eventually start another investment account (Roth IRA maybe?

Company threatening to take pay out tomorrow for a car that was totaled,"As the title will tell you, my mother bought a 2009 Subaru from a local car company under the belief that her credit score wasn't optimal for brand name dealerships selling a car to her. Now, unbeknownst to me, this company sold my mother this Subaru for x3 more than its actual value, but a few months ago there was a hit and run situation in which the driver of another vehicle rammed into the rear end of my neighbors vehicle, the force of which was so great that my neighbors car was pushed forward and rear-ended my mother's car, pushing up her gas tank and other parts of the vehicle that totaled it.

My mother was still paying off the car at this time and her insurance sent a monetary check to this dealership. According to my mother's insurance agent, once the dealership received that payment they should have begun the appropriate paperwork to file for whatever gap was leftover for the payment of the vehicle. However, my mother received a text from the dealership stating that they would take out payment from her bank account for whatever balance was left on the vehicle that was totaled and that they haven't started any proceedings for the gap insurance and that it would take 4-6 weeks for such proceedings to finish, but that in the meantime my mother would need to make payments on the remaining balance for the vehicle. My mother is worried about now having to pay for this vehicle, the new one she has, and other bills. What should she do in this situation?

Should I max my 403b before contributing to an IRA?,"Hello,

My employer contributes 6% to my 403b without requiring me to contribute anything. I was thinking about opening an IRA, but after looking into both IRA's I realized that I would not qualify for the Traditional IRA tax deductions, and the only way for me to max out the Roth IRA would be through a Backdoor IRA due to the income limitations. 

Should I forget about the IRAs and just focus on maxing out my 403b contributions? Or can I still benefit from opening an IRA and not maxing out the 403b? 

Thanks for reading!

Additional information:
I live in NYC. I've only worked full-time for 10 months this year and made about $120k with $8k contributed to my 403b. I expect to make about $130k next year since I get paid hourly.

market timing,"I've noticed a lot of posts lately from people who want to pull out because stock prices are going down and the TV says ""bear market coming"" - enough to make me wonder why so many people post before even skimming the top page to see if someone else had the same question. 

From the few posts that I've read it seems like they are usually from young people just trying to figure out how it all works, so they don't have a lot of money yet. I'm sure there's also investors who stay naive their whole life and never think to even come here to post a question without reading anything first. 

This got me thinking about the more philosophical side of the market. If you look at the graph of any index, it looks random. It isn't more likely to drop after going up quickly, or to surge after so much time or % of a drop, or any other logical pattern. 

There is a reason why this pattern looks so chaotic - because if any pattern starts to exist, someone will crack it and it will no longer be the pattern. If not for people timing the market, it would be possible to time the market. 

So why it trying to time the market a such a bad idea - someone's gotta do it. And also - if it's so obviously such a bad idea, why does the TV keep talking about the downturn like it's a bad thing? I think I have the answers to both questions, but I lack the credentials to say with any certainty. 

To the former question, the market *is* chaotic due to attempts by people to time the market, and people are successful in profiting off of their abilities to time markets, but the catch is that it has to be a specific piece of the market. 

At the micro level that's just a regular employee choosing one employer over the other because they pay more - if the employee knows that the employer just lost half their staff, they can demand more and get it. Conversely, if there is a line out the door of people waiting to apply, the employer will take the lowest offer.  

On a slightly larger scale that's an independent salesperson deciding to take on a product that no one else in the area offers. Up from that you have a small business owner who chooses to sell a product because no one else in the area sells it, or who chooses a location based on how far they are from competitors. 

On a larger scale that's a company that a town was built around closing it's doors to move to another country, or coorporations buying out other coorporations.

Up and down that spectrum of small to large impacts to the economy, from one person's wage to a town's prospertity to the regional, national, and international economies, it's people trying to out-wit each other. Employees who want more pay for less hours vs employers who want the opposite, salespeople competing for the same clients, companies competing for the same market share, etc. 

The source of all of the market's chaos is competition amongst people, and that competition is relatively easy to understand in a one-to-one situation like one employee competing with another for a promotion, and in situations like that timing the market is hugely benificial. Stalking your competition for a job, or for a sale, is a proven technique. It works for a lot of people. Timing the market on a larger level also works for a lot of small businesses, and mid-sized companies, all the way up to gian corporations. 

The larger you get, the more complicated the market is to time. 

Meanwhile, all of us with our life savings invested in this nonsense because it's proven to work for the past few generations have realized that it all kind of follows the same pattern... everything rose steadily last year, and everything is all out of whack this year. Although competing, every company playing this game seems to succeed or fail at the same time. 

The extent to which this co-dependence amongst competitors is driven by attempts by people to time markets, or by investors like me who want to diversify and therfore buy stock in competing companies through mutual funds, or any other factors is not something I really understand, but what does seem clear is that it is competition that drives the whole thing, and that is why the charts look completly random.

But back to all the 20-something kids posting every few hours about whether they should pull out now... the point is, if you have diversity in your investments (which is wise) you rely on the health of the OVERALL market, and that market is chaotic because of attempts by people to time SMALLER markets within the larger market that our money is invested. 

Smart people can time a small market, that's for sure, and I have no idea how large a market must be before it can only be cracked by geniouses, or can't be cracked. But what is clear is that any US stock index (DOW, S&amp;P, etc) is much larger than that, and therefore fundamentally CANNOT be cracked. 

-----

Part 2

The second part of my question was why, if market timing is such a bad idea, does the TV keep talking about. The answer there is OLD PEOPLE. While market timing legitimately useless for anyone with decades of working-years left, when those decades start to run out and you are looking to secure your nest egg, it means A LOT. Timing the market for profit is a bad idea, but the timing of your EXIT from the market makes a HUGE difference.

This is why it is advised to lower your risk tolerance as you age, but it is also hugely important as to why it is reported on TV. Only the ill-informed follow this news as advice on where to move the money in their 401k while in their 30s or younger, but many more smarter people are paying attention because they are planning when to pull out of this mess and settle in for a well-funded retirement. 

If you plan perfectly and glide your way out from stocks to bonds as your target retirement year approaches, it won't really matter if your last year of planned working was a good one or a bad one, but how many people do you think actually do that? If you didn't, and you're a few years from retirement with a lot still in stocks and the market tanks that is a big deal - the difference between you retiring on time or dieing at your desk. 

That's why it's on TV. People of that age, who still have more exposure than the ""should"" have (hindsight is 20/20 right?)... have a lot to be worried about. The rest of us (and I'm 37 years old by the way)... not at all

Question about federal loan grace period and in school deferement," 

Here is my situation: I am taking spring 2019 semester off to work. I have 4 federal direct loans so far and their 6 month grace period ends in middle of june. I want to register in a class that begins end of may (which would put me at half time status) so that the grace period does not get used up.

I talked to a person at my schools financial aid office and they said that summer is not a mandatory semester for enrollment purposes, and my loans will not automatically resume a deferment status because summer is optional. They said that I will want to get an in-school deferment form from my lender’s website and provide it to the Registrar’s Office to certify my enrollment for summer semester. Doing a search for in school deferement form, I find this [https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1602Attach18450011SCHFINAL.pdf](https://ifap.ed.gov/dpcletters/attachments/GEN1602Attach18450011SCHFINAL.pdf)

I don't see anything in this form that refers to the sixth month grace period, other than in section 3 in the last check box, but I don't have any PLUS loans. Would this be the right form me or am I completely clueless and misinterpreting everything? I am worried that this form is just to stop payments only when I am in classes and after my summer class ends I would have to start paying them again. 

I would post this on r/studentloans but for some reason it never shows up. If you have any input on my situation I would greatly appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8hp8u/question_about_federal_loan_grace_period_and_in/,1545451762,personalfinance

Any downsides in an income-based repayment plan for a parent student loan?,"My mom took out two Parent PLUS loans for my degree, totalling $12,000 at an average interest rate of 7.2%. It's a Parent PLUS loan, so it's in her name, but I have some federal loans in my own name as well. When I took out the loan we agreed that I would have a moral but not a legal responsibility to repay the loan that is in her name.

I just graduated so I'm taking a look at those numbers. I just found out about income-based repayment plans. It is important to note that my mom is physically disabled, always has been, and has no taxable income. Why should I not set up my mom with an income-based repayment option, considering her payment will likely be $0 per month?

If this is an option, I do not understand why she was approved for the loan in the first place.

I still feel a bit guilty about using this money for college and not repaying it, so I would like to repay it, but not for a few years because I would like to focus on the loans in my name first. I am considering taking the estimated ~$100 for the Parent loan and putting it toward my own loans to repay them faster. Since my own payments are $400/month, I'm hoping the extra $100 would allow me to repay the loan in 7 years instead of 10. Would it come to bite me later if I do this? Like, are there significant fees or penalties in ""making up"" a few years of payments that you were relieved from during the income-based plan?

"First salaried job, wanna start off right","Hey all! Been browsing this subreddit for years. 

In two months, I’ll be starting my first full time job post-grad. I’m debt free— no tuition, no car payments, nothing like that. I have a 2005 car, but I’ll likely drive it until it breaks before buying another. I’ll be making around $5000-5500 a month, with a 5000 signing bonus.

I have two main questions:

Is it possible to get cheaper car insurance?,"24F living in TN. 

About to move out of my parents house, but money is going to be tight if I can’t get good car insurance. At the moment, my dad says my insurance is $391/month. (He pays for it; I’ll be taking over paying everything when I move out. Right now, they’re helping me save up.)

I have an at-fault accident from February on my record. Around $6000 in damages; car was totaled. 

Before that, December of 2015: about $2000 (I think) in damages. Also at-fault. 

One ticket six years ago that I think is gone. Possibly some minor speeding camera tickets? Like one or two? I never even see those; dad always takes care of it. (Yes, I know, I should be more aware/responsible for these things—tell him that.) Do those affect insurance? 

Bought a new Civic in March 2018. Still owe about $19000. 

Credit score is fair. My only credit is this car loan, which I haven’t missed a payment on. 

I’d prefer not to sell the car, as the cameras and smaller blind spots make me feel way safer than the last car. I’ve also already put 10,000 miles on it, so I’m sure it’s depreciated. I’m also a part-time delivery driver; I want to have a newer car so I’ll be less likely to have major unexpected maintenance issues while I’m doing that (ideally it won’t be forever). But I’ve also heard I might have to pay an extra premium just because of that? 

Is there any chance I can get a lower rate? Can I even get that same rate, once I’m on my own policy? Will anyone actually want to sell me insurance? 

Should I wait until the car is a year old, or until I’m 25, to move out and get my own policy? Will it make a difference? 

Obviously I know I need to shop around and get quotes, and I will, but I’m mostly wondering if/how long I should stall if I want better quotes. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8hyaq/is_it_possible_to_get_cheaper_car_insurance/,1545454044,personalfinance
"Self employed and finally got health insurance! However, I have questions regarding deductions, and possible consequences of switching to my university's health insurance plan.","I am currently self-employed, and decided to buy an ACA compliant health insurance policy for 2019! This has been a noteworthy milestone for me, as I've been uninsured ever since my family fell into poverty. Sidenote: I've already established an emergency fund, and savings for several other goals thanks to the advice from here.

Questions:

* Where would I deduct my health insurance premiums from my AGI? On the 2017 1040 form, this was line 29 on page 1. I cannot find it on the 2018 tax form.
* In late 2019, I plan on going back to college to finish my degree. The university health insurance is cheaper, and is rated as a platinum plan. I have two options: 1) Switch in August to the university health insurance plan, or 2) Switch in January of 2020. If I opt into the university's plan, it will be added to my bill as a line item. Would I be able to deduct what I pay for university's health insurance plan on my 2019 taxes?
   * They bill for the entire year, so it would cover part of 2019 and 2020. Would the deduction be split between both years, even though the full payment was made in 2019?

Assumptions:

Accident Claims.,"I recently just got into an accident yesterday where I was hit by a car while crossing a pedestrian crossing walking back from working late. (M19) currently living in NZ. I have never claimed anything before. Is it possible to claim to clothes? as they had to free me from the clothing? the reason I'm saying this is because it is my favorite outfit and had just brought it. I am really keen to hear from anyone that has had something similar happen as I saved so much for them and would like to get them back if possible. :( (note I am fine now got discharged this morning with only minor injuries to the left side of my body) Thanks to anyone that can provide advice, have a lovely day!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8i6d3/accident_claims/,1545456078,personalfinance
[US] Secure Fax Service for Asset Transfer?,"Hi all,

This might be a little off-topic for here, but I'm trying to consolidate my various financial accounts; my new employer uses Fidelity for their benefits, and I don't see any major downside to going ""all in"", to have everything in one spot for convenience's sake.

Unfortunately, Fidelity requires either paper mail or faxes for submitting the Transfer of Assets forms; they don't have a secure document upload portal that I can find.

&amp;#x200B;

So, since I don't have a printer, does anyone here have a secure fax service that they like to use and trust with their financial info? 

Alternatively, are Transfer of Asset forms not particularly sensitive to where I don't need to worry about a services' integrity? I feel like they pretty strongly fall into the ""do not share""/""shred when done"" category of documents.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8ia8b/us_secure_fax_service_for_asset_transfer/,1545457062,personalfinance
Can my family get out of this hell portal? Student loans to bury us.,"First, I'm posting from an alt since my friends and family know my main.

Anyway, my wife and I make ~$4000/mo. 

Our student loans want $1100/mo total and won't budge on payments so we've just been paying what we can afford but now they're talking about taking our federal refund.

My wife has a few medical bills that we're paying $250/mo on but some are being neglected.

On top of these, our mortgage is $600/mo, gas and electric are $200/mo, insurance is $250/mo, and we spend $1240/mo on daycare for our 2 kids. 

We do have cell phones and internet that we spend ~$110/mo on and I know they can be disposable but these are really our only non-essential bill.

I don't know how we could possibly pay all the student loans and medical bills and still afford to eat and drive.  Is there a light at the end of this tunnel?

"Debt collectors keep selling debt and basically starting over the ""opened"" date?","So maybe I am completely misunderstanding how this works. 

Say you have a debt (in my case sprint) that was closed out and sold to a debt collector in mid 2015. Then after that it has been repeated sold to different debt collectors. 

Each time its sold however, the ""opened"" date renews. 

So, for example, it states that this debt was opened in Feb 2018 (10mons ago) when in fact it was actually sold originally to debt collectors and marked off as bad debt 3.5ish years ago. 

Is this right? I would pay the debt but the amount is incorrect and they refuse to listen to me. (Basically the vast majority of the amount is for a phone i turned back into them...I had proof up till it got lost last may in a move. I've shown the first collector and several after that this and they said they would handle it and contact me back after confirming and getting a new correct amount. It would then be sold to yet another debt collector before it was ever rectified. I have done this same song and dance with over 20 different collectors over the past 3.5 years). It seems when they renew my open date by selling it it ends up pushing my drop-off-my-credit-score date back too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8iclo/debt_collectors_keep_selling_debt_and_basically/,1545457672,personalfinance
"Lost and not sure where to start, to the point that its causing serious depression","I won't go into a long story but I made alot of mistakes over the years and really racked up alot of debt, lost my job of 15 years and things got way worst really fast. I am now at a point where I have a new job, going on a year, making slightly more than the previous. I am currently being garnished wages till February for at least one creditor that caught up with me but there are so many more in all kinds of categories and I don't know how or where to start. I don't think I even can until the garnishment is done because its left me really caught off guard and lossing a huge chunk of income a month.

&amp;#x200B;

Debt includes:

Credit Cards (low balances but high interest and all late past due not paid)

Payday Loans (old and some in rough condition) - few thousand total

Car Wreck totaled my car and insurance didn't cover it all, 4k owed to them, so cannot get a new car

Medical Bills (maybe not the highest priority given who will come after me first)

Car Repair bill from before my accident (500)

&amp;#x200B;

So various debts all over the spectrum both extremely high and moderate interest. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a past bankruptcy from a few years ago, but still too soon to go this route to try to fix things and afraid of another garnishment. Is there a good debt consolidation company I could consider working with, I once used Debtscape and they helped me get all my debt paid off in couple years, but they don't exist and now most companies are a scam I don't know what to do, how to do it or where to start.

&amp;#x200B;

I plead for some guidance. I know reaching out for help is the first step. I see so many success stories in here and even if I can get a game plan to start it would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure how much more of this stress I can take and my medical bills (Current) take up a good portion of my monthly bills, rent, cell phone, rental cars every other week (about 200 a month) and eating (cooking at home) along with some misc items.

Will my Inheritance money effect my financial aid? :(,"Hi, I’m 21 years old and my father passed away last year. No need to spare me your condolences but thank you for your thoughts. It’s not easy losing someone and on top of that mess, probate and the legality of things makes everything very complicated. 

I inherited 50,000 dollars in PA. Since I was younger than 21 I didn’t have to pay tax on it. After a year, I only have 30,000 dollars left. Not completely sure where it all went, but I know the money had to be used for a number of things. The funeral, gravestone, loan on his truck, probate. What I’d like to talk about is less about my unwisely financial decisions and more about what it means for my Financial Aid. 

For the section called Student Information” the FAFSA asks you, “what is the current amount in savings and checking accounts.” I’m worried because of the amount in my checking account and savings that I will miss out on what I could have received without the inheritance in the bank. I’m transferring offer to a four year college from a community college, so I could really use all I can get.

I work under the table and only receive 100$ a week to get by on. My mom doesn’t help me pay for school and I have bills to pay which has forced me to dip into the inheritance to stay afloat. Since I’m a dependent, I don’t file my taxes because I’m a full time student, and I’m not on the books. (Not sure if that’s smart) 

I am wondering, what are my options? 

Is there something I can do with the money so I don’t have to report it?

This is what I was thinking of doing. Putting 6,000 into a Roth IRA before 2019, then after the new year, if I’m able to, put 6,000 more into it. I read online I don’t have to claim that in FAFSA and it’s an investment. 

Is the IRA a good investment idea and minimal solution? 

Then I was going to put the rest into a CD in the bank. This way I won’t be allowed to touch it because of the penalties on withdrawing it. I thought that the FAFSA would consider this and not force me to use the money since it won’t be available to me. OR
Put the rest in a new bank account in my older sisters name, who is very close to me and would not take advantage of having access to the account.

Anyway, if anyone can help me with my dilemma it would be really appreciated. It’s been stressful and I just want to make sure the money is safe for future investments. I know my Dad would want me to use it on school but it would be nice to have it for an emergency in the future or to use on a house. 

Last question but sorta off topic and can be ignored if you don’t feel like answering. I feel this post is waay too long haha. 

His estate is in delinquent status because of his tax return. I didn’t know I had to file it to probate? I did his taxes and I used it to pay his loan on the trunk so I wouldn’t loss it to the loan company. Did I do something wrong and can I fix it?

Increase Monthly Student Loan Payments or Invest in the Market/Retirement?,"I graduated with $6,000 in student loans at an interest rate of 3.61%.  I'm wondering, should I pay more than my minimum (\~$65 a month) and use that extra money to contribute to my Roth IRA, etc.

Company ghosted me after giving me a verbal offer. Did I mess up or is the company just shady?,"I had the onsite interview last week and it went very well. The technical questions were easy and I actually showed the interviewers things they didn't know about. There was good rapport with the rest of the interviewers and I left feeling like I nailed it. One of the interviewers mentioned there was another candidate they had in the next couple of days but I should look forward to a call. 

I eventually get the call a few days later from the tech manager. He's on the phone with HR and explains that the team was very impressed with me. He asks what I expect for compensation. I politely decline and stall to give a number but they mention on my application I listed my previous salary (I've applied so many different positions I don't remember who has what information. It must've been a requirement to list that info to submit the application). After I confirm my last salary they say they're prepared to offer me \~10% less from what I previously made and that's the highest they can go. I wasn't prepared to give an answer on the spot so I asked to take a couple of days to think about it and they agreed. 

The next day I emailed the HR department to ask where I could see the benefits that the company offers. One of the cool perks my last company offered was a stipend for their employees' gym memberships. I haven't worked out in a few months and that's one thing I'm looking forward to doing again once I get a job. Once she sent me a link to the benefits, I followed up with a question asking about how the benefits work with gym memberships, as in is it a discount for local gyms or is there no coverage at all. The HR department never answered my question.

The following day I sent another email scheduling a time to chat with them later that day. The HR rep agreed to call me at my requested time. My plan was to tell them that I had a few other interviews lined up and that I would have no qualms about skipping my remaining interviews and accepting their offer if the salary was negotiable. When it was time for our phone call I received no call. I waited for an hour and still nothing. After an hour I sent them an email saying something to the effect ""It looks like you were unavailable to talk today. Please give me a call when the next time you're available."" I've received nothing from them all day. 

I'm concerned that asking about the benefits turned them off. But to be ghosted for simply asking about its details seems egregious. I've never directly expressed dissatisfaction with the benefits that they offer, and they don't even know I want to negotiate on the salary. 

Should I have been more reserved in asking about the benefits that they offer or am I dodging a bullet by not going for this company?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8il1l/company_ghosted_me_after_giving_me_a_verbal_offer/,1545459961,personalfinance
Why does my credit score keep fluctuating?,"First time posting here, so thank you in advance for bearing with me.  I'm a little confused about some stuff with my credit score.

I have almost 30k in available credit,  oldest account is 11 years.. etc.  I have done literally NOTHING different, yet my credit score dropped almost 20 points this month.  I notice it does this once or twice a year, then goes back up.  Why?

New Credit Union Benefit - Thoughts? 10% Cash Back on purchases if receipts are given to the bank,"Hello,

My Credit Union I joined a bit ago has a new perk that is interesting. I would like your guys thoughts on it, as I've never seen anything like it. The new Benefit is 10% Cash Back, maximum of $40 a year.

"Learned a hard lesson about multi city flights, and Alamo airport car rentals.","Booked a multi city flight for the holidays.    
Flight 1: LAX - SMF    
Flight 2: SJC - LAX    

Booked a car rental. Picking up from SMF when I landed, and dropping off at SMF two days later (4 days prior to my SJC - LAX fight. I do not need the car after the first two days of my trip.)

This is when the learning occured. 

Alamo, my rental company, did very much not like the fact that I would fly into SMF and leave from SJC, even though my car rental would be both picked up and dropped off at SMF. They then laughed at me and added that, in order to rent a car, your arriving and departing flight dates need to match the start and end dates of the car rental I had already paid for.

This is where the problem occured.

I do not have a credit card. In order for someone with my violent travel schedule to win the keys to a rental car which they have already paid for online, a credit card is required for the security deposit, and a debit card is not acceptable. Therefore, I was unable to rent the car I had already paid for, because my flights did not fly into and out of the same city. Alamo will not issue me a refund.

I understand that in some situations, debit cards are not acceptable for a security deposit. In the past, I've had no problem renting cars at airports with only a debit card. But, my flights were in and out of the same airport, SMF being one of them. No credit card required. My mistake for basing my investment on past performance.

After my extreme Alamo disappointment, I walked five feet to the Enterprise desk, told them my situation (parents house burned in the Paradise fire and I just want to see them already and THAT COMPANY WON'T FUCKING LET ME) and I got an even better deal on a super sweet all black leather Grand Cherokee. No credit card required. 

In conclusion. There are two outcomes. Maybe three.    
1: Alamo is poopy    
2: Read the fine print question mark I'm Ron Burgundy?     
3: Happy Holidays    
4: Stop letting big companies literally rape the planet      ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8iwpm/learned_a_hard_lesson_about_multi_city_flights/,1545463460,personalfinance
Advice for filing taxes this coming season,"Okay, I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but I will need to give a little background information.

My wife and I have been married for 2 years now, and we've filed our taxes jointly both of the years we've been married. The first year we did this we had just had a kid in 2016, we had both worked most of the year, and she had finished college that year as well. So, come the tax season of 2017 we filed jointly and we ended up getting a pretty substantial refund by our own standards. We used the refund to move out of my parent's house, purchased a used car for myself (she has her own car we bought new), among a few other necessities for coming changes in our lives (furniture, etc...).

All is well.

At the beginning of the year, I was finishing up a seasonal job and needed to look for a new job so I landed on a place in which I would be a tipped worker in the food industry. I'm not very savvy when it comes to these things, and as I was filing the tax information for the new job, I was under the impression that by following the guidelines, I was required to claim the maximum number of dependents possible. Well, since, I guess, myself counts for 1, my daughter counted for 1, my spouse counted for 1, and there was another area asking me to claim another 2 for my daughter. I read over all the information a dozen times, and didn't see any other way to construe that bit, so I ended up claiming 5 dependents.

So a year goes by and it's time to file our taxes again. My wife is entering all the info in and our refund begins to look like last year's, but then she enters the information from my work and all of a sudden our refund drops by about 90%. Of course we're both distraught and I go to check what is going on. At this point, I've barely ever even looked at my check stubs (online and I have direct deposit). I get into one and notice that absolutely zero federal taxes have been taken out of it. I start looking at all the check stubs I have available and lo' and behold, I've never had federal taxes taken out of my payroll checks the entire year I've worked there.

So, on top of having to pay taxes on all of my tipped wages, I also have to pay all my federal taxes for the year since the dependents get reflected properly in the return, as well as claiming a small amount of compensation from a side-venture that just happened to add up over the limit.

I would like to now say, we did still get a refund for last year, it was simply 10% of what we had planned on, which is our fault, mostly mine.

I told my manager that I wanted to change my info several times to not claim so many dependents. I don't know, I'm not really a super responsible guy, and he just never got around to it, and I stopped bugging him about it. Again, completely my fault and I know I'm an idiot for this.

So, here's where the real problem lies. My wife and I are going to be going into this year knowing full well that the exact same thing is going to happen, quite possibly even worse this time around, and we'll receive little to no refund and may even owe. So, my wife suggests the idea that we file separately. Her line of reasoning basically goes like this: We file separately so that her tax return yields us the large sum, and I will just have to owe what I owe. We are in a situation where we're sharing a car since the lovely used car we bought for me broke down after two years (go figure), and she wants the added convenience of us having separate cars again. So, we're supposed to file separately so we can get several grand back and buy another car, and.........and I guess she just wants me to owe the IRS a ton of money that I honestly probably can't really pay back in a timely fashion by any stretch of the imagination. I don't exactly make a lot of money.

Again, I know in the end this situation is entirely my fault. Before anyone says it, I'm going into work tomorrow and bugging the f\*\*\* out of my boss until he gets me what I need to fix my information. I just can't help but feel like my wife's idea is a super bad one. Why on earth should we essentially borrow a bunch of money to spend and not be able to pay back, to one of the largest and most powerful financial institutions in the country? This whole thing just stinks of idiocy, but I want to give her the benefit of the doubt that maybe she isn't just completely wrong, so here I am, asking for your all's opinion.

What could be the pros and cons of filing separately in this situation and would it not be as bad as I'm thinking it will be?

Thanks for anyone willing to read my wall of text and for any replies I get.

TL;DR Wife wants to file separately so that she'll get a decent refund we can use for immediate and pressing expenses while leaving me to owe a bunch of money to the IRS. Need advice on whether this could actually be a beneficial situation as neither of us are well-versed in this field of knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

\*edit\* It's very late where I am, so I will be going to bed and will be checking back here in about 7-8 hours.

\*edit2\* Given the replies from u/NYCheesecakes and u/wijwijwij I feel like I've learned a lot about our situation, and talking over all these points with my wife, it seems she's starting to understand the situation better as well. She's still not happy about it, but that has to do with our overall situation versus the factual information given. I thank all of you for your replies.

Collection Account on Report but no Contact from Collection Agency?,"On December 10th, Credit Karma notified me I had a new collections account on my credit report. It is a debt of $1700 from what I assume to be move out fees for a home my ex-husband and I rented more than a year ago. My ex was Active Duty, and we lived on base. I have a signed document stating Intent to Vacate as of August 15th, 2017, after I filed for divorce. In the military, an Active Duty spouse may not live alone in a home on base paid for by the Basic Allowed Housing stipend after divorce is filed for. (Half the BAH payment is legally supposed to go to the spouse until the divorce is final.)

Nevertheless, he cancelled the intent to vacate after I left the state, because I’d had to use a Power of Attorney to file it due to the spouse having no legal right to sign for/deal with leases on post without a POA, despite being forced to co-sign all documents. Somehow, however, I’m still being held liable for the debt. He lived in the home until a month or so after the divorce was final, as far as I know. He was other than honorably discharged soon after that. 

The housing office sent one bill addressed to him with return service to my forwarding address listed on the Intent to Vacate. I forwarded it on without opening. They did not attempt to call me or contact me directly with any of the information they had in their system (that I can prove with the signed document). The bill went to collections according to Credit Karma on June 6th. 

It is now December 22nd and this account has been on my credit report for 16 days without contact from the Agency. I sent off a debt validation letter (from the sidebar/wiki) yesterday and need to dispute it with the credit bureaus, but I’m wondering if there’s anything else I can do. 

Another thing that is concerning is that it’s labeled as an ‘individual’ debt, and not joint, as it should be for a joint lease. I called my ex, and he has the same account on his credit report, also labeled ‘individual’. 

I am not hard to contact. My information is correct on all my documents from the original billing agency, bank information, all ID, and credit information. Why haven’t they contacted me?

"Senior College student lost financial aid and have to potentially pay $13,000. I have 30 hrs to make a decision","\*\*\*if you have any question in regards to anything please please please ask me!!\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently this semester, I didnt do too well in classes and lost my financial aid for the spring semester. As a senior who was projected to graduate next semester, I am extremely close to graduating and I really want to get out obviously. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

so in order for me to graduate next semester, I could have done two things: 

&amp;#x200B;

1) go on a study abroad program and do an international internship and graduate spring of 2019. ($13,000)

&amp;#x200B;

2)stay at my university and graduate spring of 2019. ($13,000) 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Each of these options are gonna cost me the same amount of money and I dont really know what to do. for the study abroad program, I have already invested quite a bit of money: 

&amp;#x200B;

1)student visa 

2) cancelled my rent with a 2 month extra penalty 

3)and all applications fee

&amp;#x200B;

all of this costed me $1000 already... so regardless of what i choose, I may or may not have already lost $1000. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main reason that I am currently not choosing to stay at my university in the states is because I think the internship is going to be very valuable for me to jump start my internship in the future right after graduation. 

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I have filled out an appeal form for me to reinstate my financial aid but i will not know if i get it until right before I am supposed to potentially fly out of this country and i need to let the company know whether or not i can go. 

&amp;#x200B;

If i do not let the company know, I will have to pay a $3500 cancellation fee. 

&amp;#x200B;

please guide me to whether or not I should do the study abroad or not? i literally have about 30 hours to make a decision.

Is it better to resign voluntarily or get fired?,"I was told last night that I'm up for a termination review. The review will be between my supervisor and head of the Office of Residence Life only, I will not be a part of it. I was told I had two options, either wait for the outcome of the review, in which case I might get fired, or voluntarily resign before the review concludes. Based on interactions with my supervisor I think it's very likely that if I wait for the review to conclude I will be fired. My supervisor suggested that it would be better for me to voluntarily resign since in the future if potential employers asked me if I had ever been fired from a previous position, I could say no. But of course she's not exactly a neutral 3rd party in this, so I'm looking for alternative opinions. How much do employers care about previous terminations? Is it really better to resign voluntarily than to be fired?


*Note: I believe I'm not eligible for unemployment benefits. I was an RA for a college dorm, so I wasn't really getting paid, I just got compensated with free housing and meal plan. So I wasn't really earning a wage. And, I have to be actively looking for a job (3 work search attempts made on 3 separate days), which I won't be doing since I'm a college student with a full load of classes, and I'm not able to balance that with work off campus. One of the reasons I applied for an RA position is because I could do it while on campus, while I studied or did homework.

For the last two years, I have been living in China. I’ve recently come back to visit my family and due to where my parents have moved, USBanks are unavailable in their state. They’ve also slowly migrated to Chase Bank and because they’ve co-signed on my credit card and my account, I’m going to start to have to pay annual fees, expenses that I’m generally not used to paying. 

I’ve recently switched over to Chase Bank as well and have co-signed on another account and credit card. My parents are recommending that I close my account and credit cards with USBank but I wanted to discuss options, pros and cons with closing or not closing my other account. 

I’ll be moving to Europe for at least one year by January. I’m just trying to ensure I’m financially responsible for myself when the time comes. Chances are, when I come back stateside, I’ll need to take a loan on a car, etc. so I want to ensure my credit is where I want it to be.

(UK) Debt Relief Order or Token Payment Arrangement? please help!,"Last year during my first year of university I (20f) got myself into a really bad situation. Essentially, I allowed myself to be manipulated into a grooming scam, wherein I totally lost control of my finances, had thousands of pounds stolen from me, was made to take out two Rolex watches on Partner Finance and had a bank account that I'd had since I was 16 closed due to fraudulent activity. To keep me quiet the fraudsters paid off my remaining student accommodation fees (£4000), as I was unable to, as they took two thirds of my student finance from me. If my fees were not paid, I would not have been able to return to university for my second year. They disappeared with the two watches (one costing £4000 and one costing £6000) and I have been left with the debt.

I eventually went to the police, who are aware of everything, but have dropped the case because I cannot prove who these people are. Even if I could, I cannot prove that they made threats to my life, so there is nothing they can do to help me and if they were to proceed, I could face criminal charges myself.

About a month ago I was notified by my university that the payment for my accommodation fees has been claimed back by the account holder and that I was once again in debt to the university. From this I ascertained that the payment was made via more fraud.

I know exactly how stupid I sound, I know that this is all my fault and that I've been very lucky not to be facing prosecution. I've lost all my savings as well as gotten myself into crippling debt. I've put my family through unbearable stress as the people who have done this to me know my home address and have made threats upon my life and my family's several times. It is only due to a new policy that is still being drafted up that I am not losing my place at university.

I have defaulted on my payments for the watches as I cannot afford to pay them and my debts have been sold to a debt collection agency. I know my credit score is irreparably damaged, it is currently at 0. I have spoken to a debt charity who have advised me that I should either apply for a Debt Relief Order (DRO), or arrange making monthly token payments until I am in a better financial situation. After drawing up my monthly budget, it is clear that I only have around £15 to spare each month after paying my household bills, so would currently only be able to pay £5 a month towards each of the three debts. I am aware there is a likelihood that if I attempt to make reduced monthly payments, after several years the debt collection agency will get bored of me and offer me a reduced settlement figure.

I am asking anybody wiser and more clued up than myself for help in deciding what to do. I've read up a lot on DROs and I understand how they work, I'm just very concerned about how it may impact my future, namely whether or not I will always struggle to rent accommodation privately, as I know most Landlords and letting agencies do credit checks. I know I will definitely struggle to get a mortgage in the future if I ever want to buy a place and will most certainly never be approved for any kind of credit card or loan going forward, but this is just something I am going to have to deal with as I've made a colossal mistake and I can't undo it.

What should I do? Get the DRO and get the debt wiped off, leaving the evidence on my credit file for 6 years, or attempt to pay it off over time, in the hopes of a reduced settlement figure and less impact on my future?

Can I rebuild my credit score, whichever option I choose? How?

Really hoping I haven't ruined my life, although it looks very bleak. Please help me, I really don't know what to do...",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8l188/uk_debt_relief_order_or_token_payment_arrangement/,1545487450,personalfinance
"I’m 25 and have a good financial situation, want advice to make it a great situation","I’ll start with the basics:

- 25

- live at home paying no rent for another 4 months until I have to move out bc parents are selling the house 

- $21k in savings

- currently make $60k/year and scheduled raises give me a $10k bump every year until I get to the $100k/year wage. Wage will stay the same from then on with minor cost of living raises occasionally 

- no credit card or credit history

- 2 pension plans set up through work. One lump sum which current retirees receive around $300,000 for, and a recurring payment based on years of service (current retiree with my projected years would receive $2,050 a month)

- my career is construction and very dependent on the economy, so in a 2009 recession scenario I would likely be laid off for 1-2 years. However, as an apprentice for 3 more years I can’t get laid off. So I have a 3 year window to save enough for an emergency fund. Definitely want enough to not have to worry about paying rent, etc

I’m looking to move out a rent a place in the city. I know it’s better to own but I’m not ready to settle down in a location yet. I want to pay around $1,200 a month in rent.

I guess my main question would be what should I do with my savings that are just sitting in a checking account right now? 

Also how much do you think I should save for retirement? Would it be unwise to say saving for retirement isn’t as big of a priority for me because my pension is a better set up than most?

I took it a mechanic and they said, it'd be to expensive to fix.  

When I test drove this car... None of this was evident!  And on the outside the car look GREAT!!

So Roth and traditional 401ks right now both have the same exact maximum yearly contribution. (18,500, rising to $19,000 in 2019). 

This confuses me, because the money you put into a traditional 401k is pre tax and the Roth is post tax. Wouldn’t that mean your “real” cap is larger for the Roth? 

Let’s say Bob maxed his traditional 401k and Sally maxed her Roth 401k. 

If their investments went up 1%, bob really only made around .7-.8% since his gains need to be taxed, while sally’s 1% will not be as long as she waits to retirement age. 

Even ignoring gains, bob doesn’t really have $18,500 in his retirement account either, since he will be taxed on it the moment he withdraws. Sally actually has $18,500 in her account that she can take out tax free.

Am I missing something here? It seems that the cap on the Roth 401k is actually higher since you are also able to pay off your taxes on those contributions at the gate instead of baking it in for later with the traditional, with no max contribution difference between the two account types to accommodate this.

Store did a hard check on my credit and my credit went down by 30 points. Is there anything I can do?,"I went to Macy's to do some Christmas shopping for the family. At the checkout counter, the cashier told me that I was eligible for a Macy's store card which would save a significant amount on my bill. 


I initially told them that I was not interested as they would do a hard check against my credit and it wasn't worth lowering my credit over a card that I might not use(I was planning to apply for a loan in the coming months). The cashier assured me that it wouldn't affect my credit score. I asked them multiple times if they are doing a soft check or a hard check on my credit and each time they assured me it wouldn't affect my credit score. 


Against my better judgement, I agreed to get the store card thinking I would save a few bucks and gave them my DL and personal information. The cashier tried to apply for the card with my information and it wasn't approved. They said they wanted to try it again and it failed for a second time as well.

While this was going on, I got two alerts from the credit karma app that hard checks were done on my account and my credit has gone down. I asked the cashier about this and they apologized saying they have no idea why this happened and they were sure it wouldn't affect my credit score. I ended losing 30 points on my credit score and my store card was rejected too. 

Is there something I can do to dispute these queries or am I stuck with them for another 2 years?

Lost most financial value in 1 year.,"Hi all.

Roough year. Divorced cheating ex. After spending 70k on her education she took 30 k in value in the divorce.

I had my life savings in a savings and invested and made a series of wrong moves which wiped out 70% of my portfolio over the year (48k lost) . It's like the stars aligned to screw me over.

Now I am back to where I was a decade ago. A decade of hard work, living as cheap as possible, saving every dime, and its all gone.

I am having some serious anxiety and its like suffering through the divorce all over again.

I at least have my boy a third of the time. I have a good job. I met a nice woman who is looking past my dysfunctional upbringing and loves my boy.

I feel though my obsession with finances and wanting to be very financially set, has led me to a depression after losing a decade of working my ass off.

Bank is refusing to finance a car,"Hello personalFinance! I'm pretty new to posting to reddit so if I've made a mistake I apologize in advance.

&amp;#x200B;

About a month ago my Dad decided to trade in the truck he had for a smaller one. He has great credit, and has always paid all of his payments on time. He is a small business owner so his credit and truck are both very important to him.

He went to a dealership, traded his truck (which he still owned on) for a smaller one. The bank (Ally) financed the truck for him. All was pretty normal. He took the new truck home and has been driving it for about a month. Fast forward to today. He got a letter in the mail from Ally saying that they have decided to not finance the truck for him and they are contacting the dealership and he has 30 days to figure something else out. They say his credit dropped from the high 700's to now 400. He doesn't know why his credit dropped so fast and neither of us have ever faced this type of thing before. During this past two months he did open up 3 new credit cards. He had a few before but they were paid off but still opened. He got 1 credit card from John Deer ( he needed parts to fix equipment) and he got one from Wesbanco ( his bank) and another from Clear Mountain. Both have not been used, he wasn't sure if he'd get approved so he apply for a credit card from both banks. He then got approved for both but haven't used either yet.

What happened to his credit? I know asking for credit can bring down your score but IDK if it will leave a negative impact on his credit if he got approved for what he asked for. What should we do now that Ally is deciding to not finance the truck. What steps should be taken next?

Thank you for reading!

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional info. From the sounds of the letter it seems they plan on contacting the dealership and having them return their loan and having my Dad return the truck he has had and driven for over a month now back to the dealership. IDK if this matters but he asked for these credit cards after he bought the truck. Supposedly they paid the dealership, then my Dad asked for the credit card loans about a week later and got approved about 5 days after. Also he has to have a truck, he works in excavating and he uses his truck to haul his equipment from job to job so without a truck he can't haul his equipment which means he can't work. Should he ask for his old truck to be returned. The old truck was a 15' dodge double cab, he traded it for a 18' dodge single cab.

American Schoolteacher in Sweden trying to pay back student loans,"I’m a recent college graduate working in Sweden as a school teacher trying to figure out how to pay back student loans with international currency. I am also looking for helpful tips from other expats who dealt with student loans while working abroad. 

Little bit of information:

I owe roughly $85,000 in student loans.
I make a meager 19,245 SEK (Swedish krona) a month. This is about 2,127.84$ a month.

I have a solid 8 year plan to pay everything back and still save about 300$ a month. If you would like to see my breakdown please ask!

But my big questions are:

How would you recommend getting the funds back to America to pay down the loans?

Would refinancing my loan help ?

Would starting a 401(k) , IRA or Roth IRA be a smart move right now?

Since I’m a teacher, do you know of any programs out there that offer loan assistance for teachers abroad or just for teachers in general?

Anything else you think I should know about teaching or living abroad you think I should know would be great in regards to financing.

Investing for climate change?,"I've been reading a lot about climate change lately, and it seems like there will likely be a lot of noticable changes within this century (sea level rise, mass extinction, temperature increases, etc.). My target date for retirement is around 2060 (right now all the money I put away for retirement goes into a Target date index fund), so by the time I retire there will likely be a lot of changes to our environment. I read an article in Forbes about how it might be a good idea to invest in seawall companies and inland real estate in order to prepare for this eventuality. As a young person just starting out and with lots of student loans, the way into this for me would be with stocks in my 401k.

My question is, is there a way to allocate some of my monthly 401k contributions to a climate change eventuality fund? Does this even exist or is it a terrible idea?

what does -$600 mean to you???,"I read a similar post on here in regards to a refund that never was - college.  Okay so for those of you attending college this may help - but I do need some advise if anyone has gone through this before - I started attending my college a while back OSAP funded - the college has charged me late fees when they don't get paid straight away - can't help it on account OSAP is always late coming in - to avoid future late charges I checked that little box that OSAP has for the college to be paid STRAIGHT AWAY - BUT - little did I know that the Ministry has changed this.  There is no little box anymore and the college gets paid right away.  I was not told this and paid $600 the beginning of a payment for the Fall semester- about a week before the semester came to a close I navigated my way through the Banner to see a -$600!  Thinking that this meant that I owed it to the college I called them right away to make payment arrangements - found out that I didn't owe them but it was a credit instead and to expect a refund - Now mind you this was the last week of the semester okay - so I waited... and waited and nothing came - I called them again - they had used it for the Winter semester instead of sending it back and without my permission.  Now remember OSAP already paid them.  I contacted someone at the FA office to further my cause - I was contacted by the    **Manager, Financial Aid and Convocation, Office of the Registrar**  telling me that

Option to move from contractor to hourly,"My boss (Company A) emailed me to see if I would like to move to an hourly employee instead of a contractor for next year. I have an LLC that I use to contract with two companies, the other one I will remain a contractor at.  I am weighing the pros and cons and I was wondering if I am leaving anything out. 

&amp;#x200B;

2018 Company A (option to move to hourly)

\- Income- $9000 ($50 hourly)

\- Expenses- $700

\- Mileage deduction- $900 (at $.545, but my car costs approx $.30 per mile to operate)

&amp;#x200B;

2018 Company B (remain contractor)

\- Income- $12000 ($50 hourly)

\- Expenses- $1000

\- Mileage- none

Other information-

\- Total Annual Household income $120,000

\- Effective tax rate for 2018 estimated at 16%

\- Location Florida

&amp;#x200B;

I would still be able to expense all my costs related to keeping my professional licensure through company B, but company A will not reimburse for driving or materials that I use for the job.

Central Payment App?,"Hi all, 

First time posting here!

Does anyone know of a central payment app for credit cards? I have multiple cards, and it can get annoying having to deal with making multiple payments with multiple due dates. 

I am able to make the payments, and could probably set up automatic payments. 

But, I would much prefer an app or something that would be able to analyze my outstanding credit cards, take the required money out of my bank account on the first of the month, and then just make all the payments for me. Ideally, I could set it to make the minimum or a certain percentage or something like that. 

Does something like this exist?

If not, I am a developer and would love to create something like this. Not sure if it's worthwhile though, maybe there is a solution that exists that I am not thinking about.

Thank you!

Edit: thanks to a suggestion I signed up for mint.com which let me put in my credit cards and how much I could afford per month towards paying down debt. 

It then gives you a time table for how much to spend on which credit card based on what you can afford and interest rates.

I combined that with automatic payments and it seems like I’m good to go!

Do you guys think i can afford to move?,"I been looking forward to one day moving out of my parents house and getting my own place to live at. But everytime I think about doing so ,I immediately reconsider since it would be just too expensive for me to move based on my calculations. And it's all around cheaper to do so. But recently me and my parents have had a bit of a falling out and I think it becoming increasingly clear for me that I cannot continue to be living with my parents anymore due to conflicts about my personal life. I've tried looking into roommates but with the horror stories abound and with my own experience in college, I would prefer not too. 

But here's a break down off my expenses:

My income is 40k a year. And I live 50-60 miles from work. So my total commute is 2 and a half hours on a good day (which costed me $450 a month for tolls and gas before I did the Pace van)
I have about $1k saved so far
I have about $40k in student debt, I pay $150 a month currently for paying it back
I only have two credit cards with about $400 on both.
I pay $400 a month for rent to my parents
Car note and car insurance is about $400.
I take a Pace van to work which is $133 a month
Food is about $350 a month since I eat out for lunch a lot. Too much I realize
And my phone bill is $90 a month
And some misc. bills that are around $130 a month.
I try to save $200 every pay check also
And I try to leave some money left over for any random expenses without dipping into savings (like car repairs) 

It's pretty much impossible to live where I work at. Apartments there go for around $1.2k minimum with no ultilities provided. So the apartments I've been looking at are around 20 miles away, but they are in a worse neighborhoods. The ones I have seen there are $700-800 a month and provide some ultilities with them. Mostly gas, water, heat, except electricity. Some provide sewage, trash, and free parking ($800 for that one)

But considering my bills of about $1.2k a month with everything including rent. Food is wild card for me though. Do you guys think I can afford to move out? Or should I just stay with my parents for longer?

Tldr: wanna move closer to work. Rent there is about $7-800 a month not including some ultilities. Net Income is $2.2k. Base expenses currently are about $800-900 a month. Feel like I can't afford it. Thoughts?

Newly Married and Starting Out Together! Need some Home Savings Advice!,"**Background**

My wife and I recently got married this month. We're both living apart while she works on her Post-Doc in the Midwest while I live and work in the Northeast for now.  The plan is to move to WHEREVER she get a  job so we can be together.

I make about $60K a year plus benefits while running a side business that nets in about an extra $1-2K a year after taxes.  I pay off my CC balances often easily and haven't had to pay interest on any card for the past 7 years or more.

Her fellowship will grant her about $31K this upcoming year through August.

We both have separate bank accounts. I contribute monthly $480 to both my IRA accounts.  She has no retirement accounts yet so I thought we'd wait until she gets a job since her income stream is low.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current Assets**

* $3,000 in the Bank spread across multiple accounts for access
* $3,000 in High Yield Savings (2.25% APY - Currently for House Fund that is JOINT)
* $19,000 in Stocks (I check usually monthly and leave these alone.  I can sell if needed.)
* $30,000 in Fidelity IRA spread across Bond Funds, Index Funds, International Index Funds (From previous job)
* $11,000 in American Balanced Funds Simple IRA (Employer matches 3% of salary and I contribute from my check.)
* Renter AND not a car owner.

**Current Debts**

* $1,600 in Credit Card Debt, spread across several cards. Am paying it down regularly.
* $2,200 in Credit Card Debt, on one card with 0% APR for another 8 months (Mostly Wedding &amp; Honeymoon Costs)
* ZERO Student Loans for Me.
* $30,000 in Student Loans for Her.  Slowly paying these off.

**Current Plan**

* Currently, I put away at least $100 a month towards the HYS for the House Fund and some extra where possible and she contributes as well.  
* Realistically, we will get a car eventually and have to factor in future childcare costs in the next 1-2 years.  That's also something to plan for.
* We obviously do have expenses for rent, food, bills, health insurance, and other necessities so that takes a chunk out of our finances.
* We will eventually plan to get life insurance and home insurance when we finally get together physically.

**Questions**

* Should I diversify my assets a bit more in the markets or just leave them be for now?
* What's the best way to plan for children, IF that's even possible?

The guy doesn't really listen to my dad's concerns or advice and hasn't really made him any money, in fact he's lost him some. My dad is nearing retirement and just wanted someone to handle his money for him, minimizing his losses and maybe earn some dividends here and there. One example in particular is the advisor recently (just before the market downturn) moved a bunch of money out of ETFs and into non dividend earning common stock. That portion of the account is now down 20%, while what is left in ETFs is only down less than 5%. My dad urged to keep his funds diversified in ETFs because the market was showing some signs of instability, yet he did the opposite. I'm sitting down with my dad and this guy next week. Just wondering what kind of questions I should ask, or general advice for later down the road, other advisors to use, etc. Obviously my dad isn't going to just sell out and realize his losses now and move to another advisor immediately. Just want to know what I should grill this guy on to get a picture of the situation.

"I'm 22, looking into buying my first home (UK) but have no clue about the process and have no idea who else to ask!","Hi, sorry due to privacy reasons I have made a new account for this, but I've been on reddit for a few years now.

Around August I'm going to be given £25,000 from my family, once I've finished my final year at university. 

I've also got a secure job offer to start working in September on a salary of £25,000 in the same place that I currently go to university, so living with my parents isn't an option.

It's a fantastic position for me to be in and I'd quite like to get on the housing market as soon as possible, considering if I start renting I won't be saving anything and I'd rather be paying off my mortgage instead.

Now what I really need all your help for is, honestly am I going to be able to do this? The only way I currently see it happening is by using the governments help to buy scheme as that will mean I can cover the 5% deposit, but it seems like i'll have practically nothing left to live off from my salary after paying the mortgage monthly.

(My hope is I'll be able to buy a house / flat with at least two bedrooms, up to £450,000)

The thing is, I don't know if it's worth renting for my first year at the job so I can get a credit card and build up a credit score..? Will I even be able to keep up with the mortgage if I did that?

If anyone can give me some advice or if anyone has any better suggestions as to what I should / could do I would really appreciate any advice you guys have!

I (29) am trying to get all of his assets/liabilities in order. I have two younger sisters (both 26) that are looking to me to handle this. As my father passed away unexpectedly and had not prepared for this I have had to follow paper trails. Although sorting through it has been a pain, he thankfully never threw out any paperwork.

Here's what I currently know:

401K with Principal that amounts to \~$415k

BOA Checking Acct: \~$4k (Fortunately he put me on his account 2 months before he passed)

CC Debt: He has approx. 4 CC's with debts totaling \~($40k)

Trusts: Supposedly my grandfather set up a few trusts for my father, sisters, and I. I'm not aware of the amount nor any stipulations to these trusts. I'm trying to find that information out now.

Life Insurance - None that I'm aware of, although I'm searching through the mounds of paperwork. He was not employed full time at the date of his death and the only private life insurance I'm aware he once had expired 8 years ago.

401K Reallocation: Switch to Roth?,"Hello PFers,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking for some guidance on my 401K contributions and whether or not I should change from pre-tax contributions to Roth. Any input here is much appreciated!

For a little background on myself, I'm one year out of college working with a company I interned with for 3 years (really strong job security) where I'll be making roughly $70,000. No college debt, and have maxed all retirement options available between 401K, Roth IRA, and HSA. In addition to that I've also invested the tax savings dollars from the pre-tax 401k into index funds. I've got around 6 months of expenses built up as well.

I currently still live with my parents, but I'm fairly young still and neither me nor my parents have a problem with me still living at home. I am planning on moving out in the next year or two, and not having enough money for a down payment would be the only area I'm really concerned with for the switch. 

I'm a big believer that this is currently the lowest tax environment I will probably see due to the Trump tax cuts and potential future earnings building up as I progress in my career, so in my mind it would be good to take advantage of that. 

Oh, one last thing as well, I curently live in a state where state taxes are a thing. I currently am in the \~8% tax bracket state wise, not sure if that impacts any decisions at all.

I want a 50% raise. Am I crazy?,"Hello r/personalfinance!

I am currently looking into negotiating a raise for my current position. I currently work for a hospital as a Unit Coordinator with two years of healthcare experience and six years of customer service, three years of higher education, and make a base rate of $12.50/hr. My hospital has changed from performance based raises annually to a flat rate of a 3.5% cost of living increase. To me, this is insulting as I put in much more work than the other people that have the same job title in my hospital and units. For example, with the exception of one week this entire year I have either taken call, picked up extra shifts/overtime, or been floated to other units (I've counted at least six units that I float to even though I'm only oriented to my own). I have received praise from my director for being flexible, hard working, and having a positive attitude and have also been recognized in safety huddles by supervisors, our CMO, and CNO. I consistently help out whenever and wherever I'm needed, even with tasks that fall outside my job description. Basically, I rarely say ""no"". I have oriented employees to our unit and have also volunteered to take on my unit's GEMBA tracking (Lean management) board - still waiting to hear back from my manager on that one (I anticipate I won't hear back until after the holidays). Outside of work, I am working on two different certifications 

I have researched my market value on Glassdoor and PayScale and both say I am worth about $31-33k. This would put me at an hourly of about $17.90 to $19.10. I would like to request a 50% raise which would put me at $18.75 hourly. The lowest I would like settle for a 30% raise, which is $16.25 hourly. 

Is this an insane raise to ask for? Am I going to get quickly turned down by my employer and laughed at?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8munj/i_want_a_50_raise_am_i_crazy/,1545501319,personalfinance
Homebuying Information Overload,"I am in the process of looking for a home to buy. I'm currently renting, but the property is in poor condition and the price is too high to justify staying. No rentals in my area will work either (don't allow my dog breeds, or cats, or too expensive). I plan to stay at my job and in my city for life likely.

We have been looking at houses off and on, but not really searching. We are doing this on our own so far, and haven't brought any agents or anyone in until we get closer. Lease is up in May.  We have found one house that seems to be perfect at first glance. It is $95k, which is well below our budget we got from calculators of $150k. We have around $6k saved currently, but expect around $10k by moveout day. I have a credit score of 647 currently. My income is around $56k this past year and the only debts I have are some student loans (which I am repaying on a public service forgiveness plan at a rate of $50 a month) and car notes equaling $250.

Currently we pay right at $1000 for our rental, which is dramatically overpaying however we have never feel like it's breaking the bank. We have enough income after rent to still splurge on ourselves, make debt payments (including putting additional to existing debt), and still manage to have built up an emergency fund. 


So everything is pointing to us that we can afford a house, especially one that is sub $100k. My problem is that everywhere I look online I get information that is all over the place. I don't know how to get the process started. I understand this house we have found could be a flop, inspection could fail, or it could be bought before we get a foot in the game. I have a few questions.

1) If I have a house in mind that I wish to purchase, how do I start the process? Do I contact a mortgage broker first to get qualified? Do I contact a real estate agent first to help navigate the house? Do I reach out to the seller first and see if they can assist the process?

2) Assuming this house falls through before I contact anyone, how do I start the process of finding a different house? Contact a real estate agent to help us find the perfect home? Contact a broker first?


I'm really lost on the process. The biggest purchase I've made has been a car, which was a simple hour long process essentially. I don't know how to proceed from here. I know this house is perfect though (location, price, appeal) as long as we can get in and no issues arise on an inspection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8mwii/homebuying_information_overload/,1545501674,personalfinance
Had fraudulent activity on my REWARDS POINTS - who knew?,"A couple months ago I applied for a card that got me 50K in points, so added to other rewards points I had about 60K total. I am diligent about checking all my bank and credit card account balances online every few days or so (but not points, who checks those?). One day while checking I noticed in passing that my rewards points were only about 2K - I thought ok they've divided them up by card or something and clicked the link. Nope - someone had cashed out about $600 worth of iTunes gift cards using my name, and an address across the country!  

I call the bank and the first response was ""well we knew it was you because they gave us your mother's maiden name"".  I pointed out the lunacy of using (practically) publicly available information as security and asked to be passed to the fraud department. This person had also managed to change my email but only for that credit card (so I received no notices), and had also had a $3K purchase pending on that card (that had never left my pocket).  

So per the banks instructions I put a verbal password on that bank and credit cards for any call ins, put on a credit freeze with trans-union that propagated to the other agencies, and had the police come over so that I could file a report. The bank has refunded the points to me and put everything back the way it was, all passwords changed.  The bank said that if I wanted to know the outcome of ""their investigation"" I would need to submit my police report along with a letter requesting more information - I'm only interested because I have a suspicion it was from someone working at the bank (which it always seems to be for me).   

Also interesting (to me) is that I already have a credit monitoring service due to that monster federal leak a few years ago - this never triggered them.

Repossession and card settlement vs. bankruptcy?,"Hey guys, I’m currently in a financial mess. Currently working a job where my hours can total 50+ hours a week. Recently married and completely over my head in debt. 

I’m considering a few options but figured it’d be best to reach out here before I went to a law firm or any sort of credit counseling/financial advising. 

Im 22, my current gross income (including my $8.75 min. wage and average $100/week commission) is about $1975/mo. 

I’ve gone through 4 jobs this year and find it hard to keep up with my current bills. 

So far I owe $4500 in credit card debt, $33k on a car that books at $24k that I’m 2 months behind on, a small $100 medical bill and about $12,000 in student loans (which I know can’t be dismissed under a bankruptcy.)

I’m just wondering what the best options would be to take to help relieve my debts. After my take home income, subtracting any bills, I’m left with about ~$300 not including food, utilities, and gas money. 

I’m worried that if I let the car repossess that the bank will accelerate the loan and demand the $33,000 up front. Settling on the credit cards may help but still is frightening, granted the car.

How to advise a parent who will be left holding a surprise amount of debt when their spouse passes? [USA],"My parents are in their late 50s (mother) and mid 70s (father). They are married and own their house, which I believe is paid off. He has always been the primary earner. She exited the labor force in her twenties and spent decades as a homemaker / raising children, but has been working part-time over the last ten years or so.

My father refuses to discuss household finances with anyone, including his wife, but there is good reason to believe that he is deep in increasing amounts of high interest debt with no savings. I also doubt he has an active life insurance policy. And there really is 0% chance of sitting down and having a productive discussion with him about this.

Given their age difference, it is very likely that she will outlive him by a couple of decades. I am trying to figure out how to help my mother be prepared for a worst-case scenario when he passes. It’s entirely possible she will be stuck with high interest debts that exceed the value of their modest home, and with no other assets, will have to declare bankruptcy. 

My one idea is to urge her to start socking away as much as she can each year in an IRA (probably Roth just so it doesn’t need to be discussed when they jointly file their taxes). This year is tight for me, but I may be in a position to gift her a few thousand dollars per year for this in upcoming years.

Own a bunch of Vanguard funds and looking to rebalance/consolidate,"Background:

I'm 30 years old and a few years ago I left an employer and transferred my 401k to a personal IRA at Vanguard. I purchased a bunch of high yield Vanguard funds because I had such a long time until retirement and I thought the 3 fund portfolio was too conservative.

Today:

I'm looking to rebalance and consolidate a bunch of these funds to simplify things. I think there's a lot of overlap between most of these and I'm sure anyone that looks at this portfolio will think ""wtf were you thinking?"".

My approach is to take the top 4 funds with the highest yield and consolidate everything into them. Also, and I'm probably over thinking this, but I’ll also include funds that have great returns independent of share price fluctuations (higher weight to distributions, e.g. LT/ST gains and dividends).

Any tips or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I’m looking to do this early 2019. If at the end the 3-fund portfolio is the way to go, then I’ll go that route.

My goal is to retire by 50, whether that can be done I'm not sure but is the goal.  

If I average about $15,00 a year between 401/ira contributions, I don't think that's enough to retire at 50. I need to live off those contributions for 9.5 years till I can use the gains penalty free. (is that correct?).

Since that's the case, I'd like to contribute to both a work Traditional 401k and a Vanguard Traditional IRA. This allows me to start converting it to a Roth IRA via a conversion ladder so I have access to those contributions when I retire early betwen 50 and 59.5

Long term debt repayment options/suggestions needed. I'm definitely a newbie in this area.,"Hey /r/personalfinance, I have a question that may seem dumb to most, but I just hope that others can help me make my decision.

I have a few credit card accounts that went to collections 8-10 years ago when I was young and dumb. There is one account around $5700, one account around $1900, and another around $1100. I have consistently received letters from different collection agencies for these accounts but I did not have the means to make the payments and then as time went on just became numb to these letters. As time goes on, my credit has rebounded pretty well and have ""good"" credit again. Would repaying this debt hit my credit score negatively again as they will be something current on my credit report? There have never been legal threats or anything like that. I am in California if that has any impact on advice.

I now have grown up, have a decent job, and live a pretty successful life with my wife in a house that we bought from family. I have multiple newer credit cards that I use responsibility, and regularly maintain a $0 balance. The spending and credit card abuse problems from when I was 18ish have definitely been corrected, just haven't taken the time to dig myself out of that hole.

I have the ability to cash out my vacation time at work and have roughly 200 hours available to cash out, which would be worth ~$11,000 pre tax.

Would it be wise to cash out the vacation time and just squash all of that long term debt once and for all? Or should I just start saving money slowly to pay off these debts one at a time over the next year and keep the vacation time for taking time off/emergency fund.

Luckily I have a pretty high paying job and have a solid plan to comfortably get my usage down to the teens within 12-18 months.

Advice - making additional payments to mortgage or investing,"I'm looking for some advice on how to manage my extra money. I'm in my mid 30s, making a little over $50k and just bought a condo and have a 30 year mortgage for $124k. My interest rate is 4.375% and I don't have PMI. I'm going to be getting a first time homebuyer tax credit every year for 20% of the interest that I pay.

After my expenses, I'm typically able to save around $800 per month. I'm working to build up my 6 month emergency fund again, and I am almost there. I'm contributing 6% to my 401k currently (paying 1% over company match maximum) and have around $30k between my 401k and traditional IRAs. 

I was playing with a mortgage calculator and I see that if I make an additional $400 payment per month, the mortgage will be paid off in 13 years. 

Is this wise to do? In the long term, if I were to invest instead of repay the mortgage the faster, I think I could probably make more than the interest that I'm paying, and I have the first time homebuyer incentive for tax credits to not repay the mortgage faster. 

If I just paid the minimum mortgage payment, I would likely increase my 401k contributions instead and max out a ROTH IRA. I like the ROTH IRA because I would have easy access to the funds if I needed them for unforeseen housing repairs.

Thank you!

Pull out or hold? mutual funds S&amp;P. NASDAQ.,"Good day all.

Is now the time to sell? Obviously now would be the time to buy as well.

Should I buy my leased vehicle?,"I think I'm making the correct decision in purchasing my leased vehicle once the lease is up but I just want to make sure there's nothing I haven't considered. 

Not sure if this is relevant but I make around $65k a year. Rent + utilties cost me about $700/mo. Lease payments are around $230. I have $8k student debt left. I'm not hurting for money but I want to make the most efficient move possible. 


I have a 2016 honda civic Ex-L. I expect to have about 55k miles by the end of a 3-year lease that charges 15 cents per mile over $36k. This equates to cost me $3200 (19k miles * 15 cents + $350 turn in fee) to turn it back in. The residual value is $15,332.60. I see cars online on craigslist with similar miles that sell for a couple thousand more. KBB also says the same thing. 

Is this uncommon for the value of the car to be more than the residual value and do you guys think I should absolutely finance the car? I'm not exactly sure where to look to finance a car... (bank, credit union, insurance company, Honda financing). I asked all my friends and the lowest interest rate they got was through State Farm at 3.9% for a new vehicle.

Medical Bill in Collections,"First time / long time. About a year ago while home for the holidays in Chicago (I live in Denver - parents live in Chicago) I had a bit of an urgent medical situation arise. My insurance company (naming names because they blow goats - ANTHEM BCBS) denied paying the claim citing that the situation was ""an out of network, non-emergency"" despite my having a PPO and a signed letter from the doctor stating it was a medical emergency. Total BS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been fighting with Anthem to pay it since May of 2018. Long story short is that the bill went to collections in early to late November of this year.  I received a letter from the debt collection agency demanding payment about mid November\~ish. Steps I've taken to dispute this so far are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

* Called the claims dispute line at Anthem about 50 times to dispute and explain why this should be covered under my SOB.
* Provided a signed letter from y doctor outlining the nature of the emergency to the insurance company. 
* Filed a formal complaint with the BBB.
* Filed a formal complaint with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies Division of Insurance (claim is still in dispute as of today - I'm still waiting for a response from BCBS's dispute resolution department.)

I responded to the collections letter stating that the claim is still in dispute with the Colorado State Department of Regulatory Agencies  and awaiting resolution both via email and snail mail and have not heard back since.

&amp;#x200B;

My question(s) are:

* How will this affect my credit score? 
* Is there anything else I can do short of hiring an attorney to get this resolved? 

My current credit score is over 800 and I don't want this screwing that up. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8npyx/medical_bill_in_collections/,1545507434,personalfinance

401k Rollover - Remain in prior company's plan or rollover to Traditional IRA?,"Tl;dr: Is it better to keep prior company's 401k with high fees but $10,0000 in unvested money still in the account, or roll over to a traditional IRA with lower fees but lose the unvested money and the earnings on it?

For simplicity, lets say the existing 401k has $10,000 in unvested funds still in the account. The employer has show no indication of withdrawing the unvested funds and for various reasons I do not believe they will withdraw anytime soon. However, this 401k plan has expense ratios generally ranging from 0.35%-0.65%, with only a couple very low fee options. I could rollover the entire 401k to a traditional IRA where I would pay expense ratios of 0.05%-0.2% but would then lose the unvested $10,000 (my new company's 401k has expense ratios in between the potential IRA and prior company's 401k so it appears to be inferior to a Traditional IRA for a rollover). I am assuming earnings on the unvested portion belong to me. My back of the envelope math is that I would be crazy to rollover unless the $10,000 is removed from the account; all else equal, it would take a couple decades for the additional fees to make up for the additional $10,000 even before accounting for market growth and dividends.

Readers of personal finance, am I understanding the situation correctly? What would you recommend?

* I've moved to a new country, where I will be for 2 years minimum, but probably 3. In this country there is no lease option, only renting or buying.
* For reasons of keeping a decent image at my work, I can't drive a junker. It would be unprofessional. At minimum I should get a BMW or an Audi.
* I can rent a car for 600 a month which after 36 months totals 22,500.
* I can buy a used 2016 BMW for about 16,000.

&amp;#x200B;

Spending:

This  varies greatly but I think I am good here since I live within my means and are not making stupid purchases ( UNLESS they are totally worth it like mechanical keyboards )

The only fat i need trim is eating out during the week. The only time I try to eat out is when i am out with friends during the weekend. I could also be a little easier on the gas pedal but the twisties call to me.

Best investing style for someone in 20s,"I have been investing in individual large cap stocks for the last few years while in college, but I feel like I way underperform the market and that I’m making mistakes that lose me money.

I have no debt and minimum expenses. This allows me to save roughly $40k+ a year, but I have been leaving most of it in cash because I have no idea what to do with it.  I don’t mind risk but I don’t want to take on unnecessary risks due to a lack of expertise.

Being Excessed from teaching job @ 28,"Due to budget cuts at my NYC public high school, the least senior teacher in my department, and another dept, is being let go at the end of June 2019. I’ve been in the system in the Bronx for 6 years now, and I’ve enjoyed it quite a bit. But I feel like now may be a good time to take a year to move out of NYC with my partner (4 years but long distance always). I have ~$115K between savings acct, stocks (well, a little less after this past month in my stocks) and miscellaneous investments. 

I’m considering doing one year of private tutoring and not working full time. Is this adviseable at 28? I feel Im fortunate enough to have a nice savings account and that perhaps a year off from teaching would

Is my understanding of how capital gains tax works correct?,"The tax rate depends on your income and how long you have held the investment - let's just say that for us it's 15%. That means 15% of the gain, payable when the investment is sold. For example, $100 goes in and over 10 years grows to $215. 10 years from now when you withdraw the $215, your gain was 215-100=115 and your LTCG tax is 0.15x115 = $17.25.

When you buy mutual funds, you also have to pay a small amount each year, even in years where you make no deposits or withdraws on the account, as the result of shares being sold by the fund manager for various reasons. I don't need to know the specifics of why that is, I just want to confirm the last part: 

When you go to withdraw the money in the future, you'll be charged the *remainder* of the LTCG tax calculated as 15% of the gain, that you have not already paid.

For example, again $100 in for 10 years to grow to $215, if you had to pay $0.50/year each year that the money was in the account, after 10 years you would have already paid $5, and upon withdraw be charged the remaining 0.15x(215-100)-5 = $12.25

When to rent vs. buy property in NYC? Are we in a position to buy or should we keep renting.,"Husband and I are 26 and we make $164k base, about $193k including bonuses and commission. We currently have about 30k cash in a savings account, about 35k in a 401k, and about 15k in a brokerage account. We live in Brooklyn and spend $2000/mo in rent (monthly expenses ~3600) and are looking to move to Manhattan. We would like to increase our budget to $2400-$2500/mo and are looking at one bedrooms. Most places that look halfway decent are 2700-2800$/mo (with yearly increases of 200+$/mo) and for 2800-3000$/mo we can maybe take out a mortgage on a 1BR in Manhattan (Midtown/UES/UWS). It's making us seriously consider if we should just consider looking to buy something. We'd prefer condo over coop because you own the place rather than shares in a corporation, don't deal with coop board and they appreciate more than coops do. Does it make sense to take out a mortgage for the long term, should we see if we can get a loan for the down payment from our parents to avoid PMI.

I feel bad every time I give up an opportunity to make money. Does anyone else feel this way? How have you handled it?,"I have this problem in multiple situations. For example, I am a physician resident and I get 4 weeks of vacation per year. I am able to work during those weeks and make $500/day in a second job. Because of this, I am hesitant to take any actual vacation because I don't just see the cost of the vacation, but mentally I add an extra $500/day on top of that because of what I *could* have been earning. 

In a similar vein, I am starting to look at jobs after residency. I want to be in a few certain cities but those jobs will probably pay around $300-350k. Meanwhile I hear of opportunities in slightly smaller cities paying $550k+ and it makes me ask questions like ""is it *really* worth it to essentially pay $200k/year just to live in this city?""

"How can I help my disabled Father in-law get his house fixed? (Illinois, USA)","Thanks to anyone reading and offering any advice.

Father in-law (FIL) has cerebral palsy and is 63. He has trouble moving around and gets very little income. He draws just over $600 a month from SS and gets around $100 a month for food. Most of his income (almost all of it goes to utilities and food). 

His house is very old and in disrepair. We recently helped him get hot water, a washing machine, and a kitchen sink (none of which he had for a few years). He has received some government assistance including the installation of drywall, foam insulation, and a furnace but has been unable to receive any further help in years.

At the moment, the biggest issue is his roof is leaking in multiple places. Roof replacement can be very expensive, especially compared to the value of the home. We unfortunately aren't in a financial position to pay for further repairs.

Many folks in his area (rural southern Illinois) have gotten similar improvements to siding and their roof.

What can we do to help him get assistance before something catastrophic happens?

Is there something we can do to help get more money? 600$ doesn't seem like anyone could live on that...

Should I reduce 401k contributions to increase savings for eventual home down payment?,"Currently 27 years old and have just over my annual salary's worth saved in my company's matching 401k and Roth IRA combined. From the rule of thumb articles I've seen online, it seems that the target is to have your salary's worth saved for retirement by the age of 30 which I am well ahead and will be maxing out my IRA contributions for 2019 once the new year hits. I also have no debts of any kind and 3 months of emergency funds have been saved as well.

My goal has been to save for a down payment for a house which currently I have 60% of my target goal saved in my high-yielding savings account. I would like to reach my goal sooner rather than later since I'm currently projected to reach my savings goal in about 4-5 years.

With all this in mind, would it be wise for me to reduce my 401k contributions from its current 20% annual contribution rate and scale down to 10% contributions so that I can save more money in my savings account that will eventually go towards the down payment? I would still be well over my company's matching at 6%. I would later review my financial situation once my savings goal has been reached to determine if I can scale my retirement contributions back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/a8phi9/should_i_reduce_401k_contributions_to_increase/,1545520024,personalfinance
"Quadriplegic uncle just died, aunt has no assets or income, life insurance goes to estranged sons. What can we do?","My uncle (we'll call him Sam) had MS for the last 30 years or so. Within the first 5-10 years, it was fairly aggressive and he was paralyzed from the neck down. He had two sons - one of which took advantage by stealing Sam's identity, starting credit cards in his name, using those cards to pay off his car, etc. They put him in a nursing home where my aunt (we'll call her Dana) met him. They ended up seeing each other and getting married. She then becomes his wife, live-in nurse, and full time caretaker. 

Fast forward to this month. Sam's now in his late 60s, got pneumonia, sepsis from a bedsore, and ends up on a ventilator in the hospital. Things aren't looking good. Son comes to see him and say his goodbyes. Sam can't talk, but can listen. I wasn't privy to any of the conversation. Within two weeks, Sam is gone. 

Sam only had two life insurance policies from his employer in the 70s. Each is worth 10k, and Dana did an assignment to use about 6k for the funeral. However, we just found out that Sam's late mother and estranged sons are the only beneficiaries on these policies. 

The only son I've met - who was also at the funeral - agreed to let the funeral home have their 6k. But my aunt has been out of the workforce for over 20 years, is in her mid-50s, has no assets to speak of, and now has mounting hospital bills.

"In need of a new car, what can I afford?","Its come to the point where I'm putting so much money into my 2008 BMW 335xi that I need to get rid of it. It currently has a misfire which I'm quite sure the symptoms are pointing towards injectors. A new set is about $1300, I put $1800 in it earlier this year for a used transmission. It needs rear brake pads and front shocks but I will have to take care of at least the front suspension because it is just bottoming out when I hit a tiny pothole(this is very recently an issue, injectors have been showing signs since summer but they're also getting worse). 

In short, I cannot afford the upkeep for this car. It's been a nightmare since I've had it, and it needs to go. I need a vehicle that has great liability and won't need major repairs. I'm interested in models such as the Toyota Corolla/Camry, Honda Accord, Nissan Sentra, Mazda 3, Subaru Impreza. I'm looking for a year and package that allows for some tech. Preferably aux and a back up camera. Heated seats would be a bonus. I'm really interested in the 2014+ Toyota Corolla. I love the tech it offers and the reliability of a Toyota need not be questioned it seems. 

My situation: 
Currently work full time 40/wk and bring home just shy of 450 weekly after tax. I have 7500 in savings including emergency fund. My bills:
Gas: $200/month
Insurance: $114/month
Food: $225/month 
Phone: $30/month
Leisure: $75/month
Netflix: $10/""""
Gym: $11/""""
Spotify: $11/""""
Prime: $7/"""" 

Total: $683 

I could probably cut back $25-50 on food, $50 on gas if I get one of the vehicles I'm looking at. I'm moving out of my parents house come June however, not looking to spend much on rent but the market isn't very cheap where I will be relocating to (West Philadelphia) so let's assume it could be 650 split no utilities. I would need to find a job as well, and could be potentially making less than I do currently (would do my best to increase income). So i need a good cushion, but June is months away and I expect to save another 2-3k potentially. 

My current vehicle appraised at nearly $5000 at a BMW dealership, this was a trade in value that I had negotiated. (They had a used Subaru WRX I decided I could not afford.) Car is also for sale on craigslist at $6500. Value of these cars via private seller has plummeted in the last 6 months. I would take $5750 or even $5500 after repairing the suspension and brakes at this point. 

I have no credit. 0. I applied for a discover it and got denied last week. Moving to secured application soon. My father mentioned he would be willing to cosign for me if need be. I was thinking I could afford something up to $10500 with a $1500 down payment and my $4500-5000 trade in. My insurance would likely be close to $200 for full coverage however, I'm in my early 20s. I could also go private seller but I dont want to spend a lot of my savings as I will be moving out in June, with my SO who will be splitting rent, I will most likely have to cover security deposit as she is just getting out of school but has a job lined up ($40000/ first year expected to be $70000 3rd year).

I need to know what is my best option here, being that I have no credit. I don't think private seller is a terrible option but my car has been for sale for 6 months and no one has even come to see it. I'm worried more major repairs will be necessary soon and it's a big weight in my financial situation currently, which is stressing me out a ton. I'm in need of good reliable transportation for years to come. Let me know what you think is my best option or what price range I would most comfortably afford. Any advice is appreciated.
