Work is on hold due to a lawsuit. What can I do to help myself financially until the lawsuit passes.,So I recently started a new job. A lady got killed doing on the job and a judge put a Temporary Restraining Order on the Jobsite(basically). We haven't worked for 2 weeks now and it's basically indefinite when work will resume. I can't get my tools from the jobsite either because they are part of the TRO so I can't just hop on somewhere else. Any advice on what I can do in the mean time?,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7k5bun/work_is_on_hold_due_to_a_lawsuit_what_can_i_do_to/,1513402166,personalfinance
Paying auto-loan with a CC (credit card)?,"I'd like to pay off my remaining auto-loan with a credit card? I was told it's possible if the lender accepts it, but so far I've not found one that does. Can anyone tell me if this is possible at all, and if so who would accept the CC?

Mortgage as S Corp owner,"Hi. I moved to Florida and I want to get a mortgage because Im done with paying rent. I was planning to buy a single family house up to $250k but I am sure that I will not get a mortgage like that in my situation so I want to try to buy a condo up to $130k first. I am in late 20s, my TransUnion score is 750 and my Fico is little under 740, i can increase it a little bit by paying off my CC, I also have an auto loan with $8k left (I can pay it off if that helps), Im a S Corporation owner which makes it difficult to get a morgage. My adjusted gross income on last years tax return was $19k and S Corp ordinary business income on form 1120s was $14k. I could also put up to $15k as down payment. I want to know what are my chances of getting a morgage before applying for it. My lease ends in March so I would really want to buy something without having to extend my lease.

Having all that, how much do you think I should be eligible for? 

Is it better to try to get an FHA or Conventional loan? 

Is personal income the only factor or is S Corp income counted as well?

What are my options and what should I start with to increase my chances of getting the mortgage? Every lender that I spoke with is saying something else.

Take out everything thing from 401k? Or leave it,"So my parent just decided to retire for medical reasons. Between the money from social security and the payments from her pension, she actually makes more than she was while working. Here’s the question: She has about 27k in a 401k. Should she leave it there? Or pull it out? If she pulls it out, when should she pull it out? (This year, or next). Most of her extra cash right now has been going to fixing up little things(back porch steps, front porch painting, new roof for garage) that she didn’t have time to get done before. I am trying to convince her to take a little time to travel.

Note: 57k is left on the mortgage. She pays the minimum, and doesn’t seem interested in paying it off early. (The plan is I will get the house when she passes, or decides to move out. And since due to health issues she doesn’t think she will be in the house for more than 8 years I think she doesn’t see a motivation for paying all of it off now... I also don’t mind paying whatever is left whenever she gives it to me)

27 and trying to plan for the future.,"So, I'm 27. I was in a car wreck 2 years ago where I was hit head on by a state trooper. He was 100% at fault and I'm due to receive my check in the next week or two. I will get just under $300k. I have two questions...

First, how can I build my credit back up? It's tanked since I have some charge offs and medical bills in collections from not being able to work during my recovery time after the accident. I plan on paying off all debt, including my student loans since I just graduated college. I want to build my credit score back up so in a few years if I want to buy a house, I have decent credit for that. By paying the debt off, will it help at all? Is there any way to remove the charge offs from my credit now instead of them haunting me for 10 years?

Second, I will obviously have money left over, as my debt amount is under $60k. What are suggestions for investments? I currently deposit 4% of every paycheck into a Roth account, but should I start another one with the initial lump sum of $5500? If I do this, should I make yearly deposits of the same amount? Mutual funds interest me as well, and I would like to find someone to help me invest, but what should I keep for a safety versus risking? I'm learning more and more everyday about the financial side of the world (my majors were political science and Spanish) but I want to be sure I have money for a few years down the road to put down on a house and 40 years from now when I'm ready to retire.

MAGI and Roth IRA for ACA Credits,"Hello! I hope somebody here can help me out.

I am a full-time student who gets health insurance through the Marketplace.

Once it's in a Roth, I won't pay taxes on it again. How is it possible that I don't include it in AGI?

For reference, here's the page: https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-calculate-your-modified-adjusted-gross-income-4047216

My 401k plan got rolled over to an IRA and... what do I do about the 20% that's witheld?,"~~About a year ago~~ On September 2016, I got some papers from my previous employer's 401k plan saying that my vested account balance will be rolled over to an IRA at Fidelity if I don't do something by November 2016.

I didn't do something. 

Fast forward, I manage to log into my account in Fidelity. I notice the amount I see there is different than what I remember and was charged some kind of custodian fee, and I'm like, ok, I should know what's going on here. I google around and find this info:

&gt;...If you roll over from an employer plan to an IRA, the plan’s custodian must withhold 20 percent of the amount you move. You can reclaim this withholding when you next file a tax return. You must reach into your own pocket to contribute the withheld amount or the IRS might tax it and assess a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty. 
([https://finance.zacks.com/ira-transfer-custodian-10605.html]

So about that reclaiming... I didn't do anything special for my tax since the rollover happened. Did I just miss the chance to reclaim? What's the part about reaching into my own pocket? Did I already get a 10% early withdrawal penalty?

HSAs and High Interest Savings Accounts?,"Hi /personalfinance.

*I'd like to preface this by saying thank you for being a library and round table for those who seek financial sovereignty.* 


I’m in the process of setting up an HSA through my current employer which has raised a few questions, particularly involving savings accounts and APY. My main bank is a small bank in the northeast US which has 0.01% APY on their savings/checking accounts. I see that several banks (Ally, Discover, etc) offer a higher yield savings account ~1.25% APY. The HSA enrollment paperwork asks for a bank account to deposit the money into, leading me to believe that the only thing my employer actually does is green light the transaction since they do not contribute to my HSA (as I understand it that is rare anyways). 


My current situation: 

* 50k/yr gross between 2 jobs
* Average Expenses: 2.2k /month including Student Loan Payments
* 12k total remaining on student loans (One loan (2k) remains at 6.8% the rest (10k) at 3.4%) 
* 1 year until student loans are paid off barring impending financial emergencies

Questions:

* Should I max out my HSA even when I'm paying still paying student loans?
* Should I move my emergency fund and my HSA into a high yield savings account?
* When I need the money from my HSA, is it as simple as using a debit card?


**TL:DR: Where to keep emergency funds and how much to allocate in HSA when paying down medium interest debts?**

"Mother can't afford her health insurance plan's out of pocket maxmimum, reaches it annually.","Hello,

My mother has Crohn's disease and the infusion treatment she is on costs something like $9,000 (~$5 medicine, ~$8995 administration) per visit (8 or so visits per year). Her out of pocket maximum is $5,500, so she hits it after the first treatment of the year--if other medical expenses have not already caused that to happen. This means that she has medical bills piling up year after year. She gets put on a payment plan for two years, but as they stack up, they will become unmanageable as she makes about $37k/year. $37k is not a lot when she's single with a mortgage, but it is enough that it makes her ineligible for financial assistance with her medical bills. 

I am going to be able to cover her bills for her this year, but I worry that in the future I will not be able to afford it as my own expenses grow. 

She is considering going off the treatment, but I am hoping to avoid that if possible as her doctor thinks it is best. 

She was sending them $25/month just to try to be in a paying status, but they recently sent her a legal notice saying they could garnish her wages or put a lien on her house. Garnished wages would probably financially sink her, and a lien wouldn't be good either. We have tried to negotiate the bill with the hospital, but they will accept nothing less than he full price of the bill.

"Putting less than 20 down on a house, even though I have the money?","I am looking at a house that costs $325000. I am considering whether to put down 20% or just 5%. I have enough money for the 20% down, but I think it makes more financial sense to just put down 5% and invest the other 15% in something else. Here is my math:

If I put 20% down:
Down payment = 65000, mortgage = 260000
Total interest paid at 4% interest rate = 186861
Total cost of home = 325000+186861 = 511861

If I put 5% down:
Down payment = 16250, mortgage = 308750
PMI = 160 per month * 92 months to build 20% equity = 14720
Total cost of home = 325000+221897+14720 = 561617

The house costs $49756 more if I put less than 20% down, but since I put only $16250 down in scenario #2, I have extra cash ($48750) on hand which I can invest elsewhere, and have it grow at 8% rather than the 4% appreciation if I had invested in the house itself.

Why doesn't scenario #2 make more sense in my case?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ku67t/putting_less_than_20_down_on_a_house_even_though/,1513699528,personalfinance

FAFSA - Now an Independent - Assets?,"Few questions!  

* First confusion: I see [EFC Calculation here](https://ifap.ed.gov/efcformulaguide/attachments/071017EFCFormulaGuide1819.pdf), but when I apply on Fafsa.gov or whatever, I don't see this information being at all mentioned.    
* I'm 22 years old. **I will be 24 for the 2018-2019 school year, so I will qualify as an independent** 
* I have 10.5K in stocks. (Taxable account)   
* 3K in the bank
*  13.5K income on 2016 taxes. Haven't filed yet (I wasn't going to owe taxes and I totally forgot. Filing this week).  

Questions:   

* On the EFC Calc, I qualify for an asset waiver/they don't look at my stocks+bank account. I haven't gone in and filed FAFSA online, but I believe they ask this. **Will they or will they not consider my liquid assets?**  
I'll happily move the 10.5K into a Roth IRA so it isn't considered for FAFSA (and retirement planning is great), but if it won't be looked at, I'd rather have it for emergency after I graduate and move.   
* If they do look at it, how does it impact FAFSA/EFC? If tuition is $8K/year and I have 10.5K + 3K, what happens?   
* I should file taxes first right?   
* I see there's a paper option or whatever - should I do that to potentially guarantee my assets aren't considered?

"Got a job offer, it is likely I will get a better one, need to respond to first offer in 2 days","Hi all, I think this would be a great place for advice. I'm in a situation during my interview process (senior in college looking for first job). I received an offer from a large, well-known firm for an entry level position. While grateful for this opportunity, it is not my first choice company or position. I finished a round of interviews for another job which is much more preferable and likely to pay more, likely $5-10k more. Those interviews went very well, with my last interviewer virtually telling me she wants me to join the team. However, there's still that chance I don't get the job. I'd hate to turn down the first job without having a formal offer from the other. They need to know on Monday, won't give me an extension (I've asked), and the potential job will be a few more days at least before I get a response. Has anyone been in this situation? Do I accept the first position and continue waiting to hear back about the second? I'd hate to turn that offer down, and then not get the second. I'd also hate to burn bridges. Both positions would not start until June. Any advice is very appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7karl3/got_a_job_offer_it_is_likely_i_will_get_a_better/,1513471248,personalfinance
Should we file separate tax return? Married half a year but also head of household.,"This will be my second time filing tax return and still don't  have a good grasp on it. I'm having conflicts and confusion about filling in. Ive done a little research on when to file separately vs jointly as I've been recently married ( since May 2017). 

Here's where confusion kicks in, I've been head of the household for my mother and brother since but never claimed them as dependent ( not sure if they fall into criteria). I am aware I can't claim my mother under filling due to her citizenship but am I able to claim my brother since he is a US citizen, a full time student, not married but over the age of 21? Both mother and brother live under the same roof but I have not lived with them for over 3 years. I support them 100% and send $ online.

Another add to the confusion is being recently married. Would this benefit me further by just filling in jointly? I should mention that my husband has recently ended his contract and has been unemployed for about 2 months (not sure if that helps, he has not spend anything on job search so far). I'm not sure where to go on from here or where to benefit more from. Advices or clarifications would be greatly appreciated.

I think I completed a transaction on a hijacked POS device,"Not too long ago I was in line behind a guy whose debit card had a chip that didn't go through. The cashier was lackadaisical and the guys tried it multiple times saying it was prepaid and worked before, and finally paid with cash at the end.

I didn't think anything of it until now and wondered if someone would be able to hijack a POS station. I searched it up and read that people can insert a fake card that installs malware and records card info and PIN from the system and go back with another card that downloads the data after. The normal method described is to insert the card, process the payment and the card won't work. The person would then pay with cash and leave, returning the next day with the other card to download the data.

I'm here to ask if it was overkill to get a new card because of this? The only reason why I suspected it in the first place is that when I glanced at the card he was using it was mostly black with a gold streak. It wasnt something I saw before and it wasnt until I got home that I considered that it may have been fake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7j888b/i_think_i_completed_a_transaction_on_a_hijacked/,1513052715,personalfinance
Thinking about buying a condo unit in ~1 year GIVEN that I acquire H1-B visa next April (currently on TN). What should I do with my taxable investments?,"I'm thinking of buying a 1-br in Seattle of $500k - $700k in early 2019 (however, Seattle housing price seems to be increasing at a rate of 10-20% yearly now).

I currently have **$39k in taxable index funds**. It was this June that I started investing, so everything I earned is short-term gains, meaning I'd have to pay high taxes if I withdraw now. Also **$18k in my company stocks** (at today's price) that I received as RSUs this Nov.

Additionally, FYI:

* ~$180k salary ($130k base + ~$50k RSUs)
* **$30k in CD** of 2% interest (ending on Dec 2018)
* **$10k in savings** account at 1.25% interest.
* $10k as e-fund in high-yield checking account at 5% interest.
* $19k in 401k (won't touch this)
* **$6.4k in Robinhood** for fun money(?) (currently negative returns of $100).
* No debt

I think I can save about $40k additionally til the time I buy a condo unit (unless I get fired. But if I were to get fired under TN, I'd have to leave the US anyway).

So if I were to treat my $10k in checking account as my e-fund, I can say I currently have **~$103k** for down-payment, and will have **~$140k** when I actually need the down payment.

I'll only buy the condo if I have H1-B visa next April, which chance is ~30%. If I don't get it, I'll try again and again as long as I'm able to. Probability-wise, I think it's likely that I'll get it in 1-2 more tries (i.e. in 1-2 years).

Ideally I'd leave the taxable investments alone until I need them for down-payment, but I think we can more or less agree that there's certain signs that suggest it wouldn't hurt to be ready for recession in near future.

What may be the best course of actions in my situation? I'm thinking:

* maybe I should start withdrawing money from my index funds starting next June so that I pay long-term capital gains.
* Or maybe it's about the time that I cash out now despite the short-term capital gains, because it's theoretically not wise to have ~50% of assets in index funds when I plan to make a large payment in a year or two.
* Or maybe it's silly to bet on my H1-B application and move the funds at all.
* Or I need to make bets by leaving index funds alone, or even double-downing since housing price is increasing fast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7mj6e0/thinking_about_buying_a_condo_unit_in_1_year/,1514422326,personalfinance
Disputing debts that have been in collections and paid on for 10 years,"My mom has 3 debts, currently down to only 5k total, that she has been doing the minimum payments on for about 10 years. She hit a rough patch about the time I started college and couldn't keep up with 2 of the payments for a while and they threated to sue her for everything she own or would ever earn... Then one or two of the collectors pretty much forced her to write a letter of non dispute to prevent them from adding fees that would have nearly doubled her total debts about 6 years ago.

Other driver in accident may have no insurance,"Last night, my girlfriend is driving her 2013 Mustang, we were headed to my parents house for pre-Christmas activities. 

Anyways, we come to an abrupt stop, the 2017 Ram begins must have been texting and nearly hit us at 50 but slowed to probably 30-35. So we exchanged drivers, insurance, police came out, yadda yadda everything is normal. 

Two hours after the accident, the guy blows up my phone, I answer a phone call and he can tell we are beginning our claim through State Farm. He starts freaking out telling us to wait two days before making the claim, saying he doesn’t actually have insurance even though he presented one to us and the police. He continues to blow up my phone when I say sorry there’s nothing I can do, she needs a car now. She needs to get to work next week, and I have to start it now. 

This dude is driving a 2017 Ram, how do you not have insurance? Did he not have collision, and just upgraded his insurance now? Did he not have insurance?

Recvd settlement offer for old debt that supposedly will fall off in Aug 2018. Should I pay it or not?,"Cleaning up your act can be so confusing sometimes!! I feel like I'm walking a battlefield here. Looking for advice.. 

I'm working on slowly paying off my debt and I received a settlement offer for a $1300 account I had with Verizon Wireless many years ago to be paid off for $500 dollars by tomorrow. The account shows on my credit report as in collection. The settlement letter came from a third party company that the collection agency who bought my debt (Pinnacle) hired out. I called the third party company that sent the letter to ask if I paid it if it would be removed from my credit report and he told me to call Pinnacle and ask them as they own it and then call him back but he def was encouraging me to pay. He wanted me to ask for him by name when I called back, to get the credit for my payment I'm sure.

I thought I had at least another year or two until the statute of limitations came up so I gave pinnacle a call and asked them if they would remove it from my CBR if I paid this settlement offer of $500 but the very nice gentleman said that they would not remove it but just list it was paid in full. He said they do not offer ""pay and deletes"". But then he goes on to say the account shows it will be removed from my CBR on Aug 16th 2018 regardless if I pay or not.. 

I asked him when I went delinquent on the account and he looked it up and said Jan 2012, which that even confused him as Aug 2018 wouldn't quite be 7 years.. But he was really nice and he said that it was in my favor and the systems are going to remove it in Aug so I am ""lucking"" out. 

I then asked him if I should even pay it and he didn't flat out say no, he did however hint that he wouldn't pay it since its so close to coming off. 

I then asked what the likely hood of them garnishing my wages for it because I've had that happen with other accounts and that is the number one thing I want to avoid mainly just for the sheer embarrassment at my job over it.. And he said it would be very unlikely that they would garnish for this account as Verizon has already sold it off and the ""type"" of account it is.

I could really use the $500 to go towards my other debts so I don't want to just pay this one if it really isn't going to matter after Aug anyways. But I'm just confused on why they would have Aug listed in their system as the fall off date when technically it should be Jan 2019 if my last payment was Jan 2012? 

And I DO NOT want a garnishment to happen. 

Would you pay the settlement or use the $500 towards a different debt like my credit cards or one other small collection account on my CBR I have from 2014?

In-Laws offer to help with Buying house. I have so many questions.,"  My landlord wants to raise our rent in February. My wife was talking with her father about it and he said we should buy a house instead. We bring home about 3,500 net/month. We have 0 savings. Our credit is under 600. Buying a house seems impossible. 

  My father-in-law offered to co-sign for us (his score is over 800) and to help with the down payment. It was surprising because he has never agreed to co-sign for anyone in his life. (I suspect he wants to leave something for the only kid of his who made good choices in her life while his health is getting worse.)

Questions:
-How much of an effect will him signing have?

-He suggested buying foreclosed, how does that work? Can we?

-My current rent is 1400, and that is not hard for us, would a house be significantly higher mortgage? (Prices for homes in my area are around $350,000-$450,000)

-I told my wife we should buy a house we like (not necessarily a dream house) because with the high market, this will likely be our home until the kids move out. Is that a reasonable expectation?

-Where do I start? Who do I need to call to find out more?

-My wife is a stay at home mother, but I could get her score much higher much faster than mine. Can she sign for the house without me? Is that legal/beneficial?

"Getting kicked from foster care in 3 months, tips to save properly and not be homeless?","So some back story I guess: I am someone in a pretty shitty situation, I live with a horrible foster parent that's extremely abusive and downright shitty. In NY (at least  in LI) residents in foster care age out of the system at age 21, and at that point, you either have a place to live, or you don't.

Luckily for me, after some mentoring by a good guy I met here on Reddit I studied my butt off and secured a job making 19.25/hr as an IT Field Tech working in the Manhattan/NYC area, I start in January and should receive my first paycheck later that month.
Before I age out of the system my plan was to take care of a few debts I owe due too some fuckups I made in the past (admittedly during bouts of depression and suicide contemplation). I owe about 2.7k in credit card debt and that's about it.

My car insurance is 270$ a month and my phone bill is 135$ each month, I typically spend 20$ on gas a week and that's all of my main expenses.

Do I try to eliminate all of my debt before March to build credit to be able to get a decent apartment? (In queens I am thinking since it'll bring my commute down and potentially save me money)

I just desperately don't want to be homeless, I already saw what happened when my foster brother aged out of the house I currently live in, my foster parent threw his clothes out, destroyed his computer he built himself in the process, and he was basically homeless for a year before someone took him in. 

I don't have any family, no friends I can depend on to let me crash at their plash, so naturally I feel a little trapped.

Should I accept a full time position while in graduate school?,"Tl;dr should I work full time during grad school even though I don’t necessarily need to?

I was just offered a job this week from a previous internship starting at 65K. I’m extremely conflicted because to me that’s a lot.  However, everyone is telling me not to take it and to focus on my studies. I currently a work part time (internship) mon-Thur and I am paid 15$ an hour. My boss is really flexible, so I work between 20-30 hours depending on my coursework. He also lets me take time off basically whenever I want within reason. I don’t have any student debt and my dad pays for my living expenses.

I’m torn because I graduated undergrad late at 25-I struggled a lot getting started with school. Now that I’m 26, and just started grad school this semester I really want to power through it. I’ve never worked a full time job and feel behind financially. I do have some savings and investments, but I see a lot of my friends/peers making 60-100K and investing for their futures. Buying homes, retirements, etc. I would probably have to go to part time and take summer courses to finish on time or just a little late. 

My dad and everyone has told me I should take it easy and not overwork myself. However, I feel like shit and I’m really insecure about my financial life. I won’t be done with graduate school until I’m 28-ish and I’m literally being offered a great job with great benefits. They haven’t even made the job public yet because my former internship boss really wants to hire me. I guess because they wouldn’t really have to train me and I did a great job.

Pay off chunk of mortgage or extend?,"My partner and I bought a flat in London about a year ago. Since then, we’ve both come into a bit of extra money and we’re trying to work out what to do with it.

Between us we have about £60k.

Our two options are: spend 10k-15k to renovate our large kitchen/diner. It needs completely gutting: walls redone, ceilings, new radiator, new units etc etc. Then use the remaining money money to pay off a chunk of our mortgage (minus some contingency) which would probably equate to about 10-15% of our total remaining mortgage cost.

Our other option is to extend up into the loft space. This would probably cost us about £40k plus £5k to buy the space from the flat below who we hold a share of the freehold with. It would hopefully add another room and a small shower room in the space. In terms of value: I reckon we’d add about £10k once all the costs of the extension are factored in.

My biggest concern about the loft is that if we ever want to sell we then end up with a 3 bed flat which might not have a buyer. I.e. a family might not want a flat when they could buy a house and a couple might not need three rooms.

Any advice?

I just checked my credit score on credit karma for the first time and the results (both calculated using VantageScore 3.0) were as follows:

TRANSUNION: 527

EQUIFAX: 534

Yikes. Under accounts, it says I have zero active accounts, though I can dive deeper and see that I have four closed accounts, as follows:

US DEPT OF EDUCATION - Closed February 4th, 2017 - $3,774

US DEPT OF EDUCATION - Closed February 4th, 2017 - $2,212

FEDLOAN SERVICING - Closed December 22nd, 2015 - $0.00

FEDLOAN SERVICING - Closed December 22nd, 2015 - $0.00

Now I can see that the total amount of debt I'm looking at is $5,986. Years of neglect and the anxiety that comes with looming financial unknowns made this number HUGE in my head so at this point, though I'm still kicking myself for the damage I've done to my credit score, I'm relieved. I'm dedicated to budgeting and taking care of my outstanding balances as swiftly as possible, but browsing here I've read about people successfully disputing these accounts. 

First of all, I'm provided with a phone number for the US Department of Education in Greenville TX but from what I've read contacting the creditor only restarts the process. I'm assuming that I should dispute the account before I contact them? If I'm ever to contact them?

Second, on CreditKarma I can dispute for ownership or accuracy. Under each of these, there is a respective column of specifics that I'm supposed to pick from. Obviously these are my accounts and I haven't been following my finances so I wouldn't know what type of error to select from the list. If anyone has any inference here, that would be great.

Now I'm not counting on these balances just being magically brought to zero. For what ever I'm left with... I'm at a loss. Who do I contact to negotiate monthly payment? There was a long period of time (2014-2015) where I didn't work or only worked for 1-2 months at a time, and in 2016 I made under $7,000. Can I use this to my advantage? I'm in Nebraska and my current income is about $1400 a month.

I've tried to keep this specific to me and use the resources on the sub to find answers so as not to be repetitive. If these questions have been answered or you have a good resource for me, links are appreciative.

One mortgage now and one a year later?,"Hello Personal Finance,

My wife and I have been married for a few years. Immediately after we got married we moved to another state for my job for a year. We moved back and have been staying with my Mother-In-Law as we save for a house. Her Mother has expressed interest in moving back to where she previously lived and selling this house she currently owns. I was asked by the wife if we would be able to help her out and sign with her on the mortgage for the debt/income ratio (I make 100K+ and her Mother makes 45Kish).

(DE/US) Filing backed taxes from 2013,"Hi All,

First off, appreciate you taking your time to read this.

Finally the time has come to file my taxes in the US back dating back to 2013. Right now I'm looking to take down 2013 and 2014 before the new year hits, since these were my most ""complicated"" years due to a 1099-MISC that comes into play. 

I also left the US in 2013 for Germany in late fall, therefore factoring foreign earned income also into the picture.

At the time, I was a W2 employee, and also the same case in Germany.

All of my taxes in DE are paid and are up to date.

Right now I'm home for the holidays and just stopped by to see a CPA, and basically he had no experience with foreign earned income, and wasn't too helpful in suggestions around potential write offs having to do with my 1099-MISC and roughly 15k in earnings from 2013.

I need some help on a few questions, and I'm hoping the community can help.

1. Is it still possible for me to personally file my state and federal taxes for 2013 &amp; 2014 using TurboTax? Can I print out what I prepare in TurboTax then just mail it via US Post then receive my finalized amount due by the IRS, and timing? Will I be receiving any penalty for late filing? Nothing was sent to me as of yet.

2. Will I still need to file a state return if I live outside of my state of birth/previous residence since late 2013? (PA)

3. If I owe money (appears I'll owe roughly 25% on the 1099-MISC earnings as it's taxes as freelance income) would it be possible for me to workout a repayment plan with the IRS myself, or do I need a CPA to help with that?

4. In 2013/2014 I had business expenses related to my 1099-MISC, such as a computer, software and other miscellaneous purposes. Does anyone have a solid list of item that can be considered to be written off when they related to a 1099-MISC? If I no longer have a receipt, will a bank statement print off due as well?

Essentially, this is my biggest issue with 2013/2014 -- getting slapped with a large sum of money due since it appears I'll be taxed as a freelance employee due to the 1099-MISC. I'm trying to figure out how to lower my taxable income - if there's any other suggestions, I'm open.

---

5. 2015/2016 are a lot less complicated - can I jump ahead and file those now, as well as 2017 without having to worry if I finish these before finalizing 2013/2014?

Again - I greatly appreciate any feedback, and I'm looking forward to finally tackling this and never getting behind again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7kohur/deus_filing_backed_taxes_from_2013/,1513633929,personalfinance
Should I visit a credit union to take out a loan so that I can afford a car?,"I have been borrowing a car but it is being turned in by the owner for credit so I need to buy/lease a vehicle as soon as possible. Should I take out a loan at a local credit union and factor the payments into my budget? 

I have a stable job that pays 40K/yr (~$2,644 monthly after tax). In addition to that I am going to pick up a part time job that can hopefully earn me an extra $600~/week. My expenses (rent, groceries, fuel, bills/loans) make out to be about $2,230 per month. With my full time job alone, this would leave me with only $414 a month in incidentals, not nearly enough as I have a child at home. 

Therefore, I need a vehicle to be able to schedule family needs with two jobs. Is taking a loan out from a local credit union a good option? What is the smartest way to either lease or buy a car with that money, and how can I best manage that lease and loan into my budget?

I'm sorry if this is kind of a mess, this is my first time really trying to get my budget into order.

[Other] Question regarding joint accounts,"Hello, all. Not sure if this question fits in this sub; I apologize if it doesn't belong.

I live in the US, am married, and my husband and I are financially stable with joint accounts at Bank of America.

My accounts with my husband are not ""linked"" to my account with my parents. The only thing linking them is my name being on both.

**My question:** Am I putting myself and my husband at financial risk by being on my parents' account?

"Receiving a ~$50,000 stock vest from my employer. Sell to cover taxes or pay out of pocket","Hi folks!

I suspect there isn't a one size fits all answer here, but as the title says, I'm about to receive a RSU vest of about $50,000 from my employer.

I am not sure of the exact amount of the taxes, but I suspect they'll be several thousand dollars. From what I understand, this $50,000 market price will be reported as income on my W2. As a result, I would be responsible for paying income tax on this amount. Please correct me if that is wrong.

Questions:

* What are the pro's and con's of selling shares that I am receiving to cover this tax bill vs. paying my own savings/cash?
* Once I receive the stock, should I leave it be or consider cashing out half and putting that into some other investment vehicle (mutual funds or ETFs) so I am not be overextended with a single company's stock?
 * Is there a recommended practice or rule of thumb on how much stock to hold in your employer?

* Housing: Rent
* Roth IRA: $5,500 total
 * Will contribute another $5,500 in January

Should i ask for a raise?,"I'm 35, have a BS in Accounting.  I joined the company I'm with five and a half years ago.  I started as an entry level accounting clerk.  Within one year I was promoted to head of receivables.  One month later I had the opportunity to apply for the position of accounting manager, similar to controller. I've been very grateful and have learned an amazing amount over this time.  My boss is fantastic and I'm very grateful to have her tutalege.  I am going to pursue a CMA certification in 2018 and plan to start my MBA in 2019.  I have helped implement a new financial software package, a new electronic health record and a new budgeting software in the last four years.  

I've received market increases, 5.5% just last year.  My current salary is 63 thousand.  My main contention is that I don't feel compensated well enough when compared to the other staff in my pay grade.  There are three other ""managers"" at my pay grade and of the four of us three positions require bachelor degrees, I'm the only one who possesses that education.  Of the four managers I supervise seven employees directly and one of my employees supervises another five staff.  I oversee every department in finance and have to be knowledgeable enough in them all to be effective.  The remaining three managers supervise a total of one other employee.  They each oversee their own department, EHR, DATA, and Facilities.

I think my main irritation is that I have far more responsibility both in supervision and in operations.  When compared to the other managers I feel under compensated.  The other gripe I have is that during our market analysis they are all compared to other ""controllers"" in other non profit organizations.  While that comparison works well for my position it doesn't pertain to theirs.  During each market analysis they receive the same percentage increase I do and have the same earning potential.

The reason I'm hesitant to bring this up is because I do really like my job.  I live in a smaller rural area that doesn't have the opportunity to job hop for money.  I would be hard pressed to find another local job that pays as well.  My boss will likely retire in the next 5 or so years and I feel very well positioned to move into that position.  I don't want to jeopardize that either.  What are your thoughts and should I bother addressing my concerns to my boss?

Need Advice on Bonus,"I have been a lurker for a year or so now and learning a lot by reading some of the posts here.  We've worked really hard this year to establish a savings, work towards paying down our credit card, and stopping to live pay check to pay check.  

Unfortunately, we had some unforeseen things happen with our house and personal lives and our emergency fund got pretty much wiped out in the last couple months.  Luckily for us we are getting a huge bonus in January (after taxes should be about $20,000).  

SO my question for personal finance....  We have about $23,000 of credit card debt from poor choices in our past.  We have been paying $500+ a month towards it this year and $200 a month into our emergency fund.  We've made some lifestyle changes and will be putting $1000 a month towards our credit card debt starting January and continue with the $200 a month towards our emergency fund.  Right now our emergency fund has $1,500 left over.  

How would you distribute the bonus?  Part of me wants to throw it all at the credit cards pay off the remaining $3,000 ASAP and then throw the $1000 we would be using on debt at our emergency fund.  The other options would be to replenish our emergency fund ($6000) and use the rest towards our credit cards OR set aside our three months of expenses (would be $10,000) and put the other $10,000 towards our credit card.

Would appreciate any and all advice.  Our goal this year is to have zero credit card debt and only use the cards if we pay it off right away AND to have at least 3 months of expenses in our savings account.

applying for healthcare.gov 2018 plan?,"Just wanted to ask something about applying for a plan since I've been part of different plan under my parents plan. 

1. Is it not possible to have my parents make the plan and for me to be covered under them? I just got a call from my parents that they called them up and was told that I'm gonna have to make separate application. Is there specific reason for this? I'm in mid 20's btw.

2. probably related to question 1, but in the application process, it gives me a quesiton "" Who are you applying for health coverage for? and I see options of my name, me and other family members, just other family members. I'm confused about how each choices differ afterwards?

3. I'm still currently looking for job and only working min wage as part timer, working around 4 days a week, 25 hours/week. Should I check if I'm eligible for low monthly pay? (my parents are willing to pay for the plan until I find full-time job but still).

4. So do deductibles exist in every health insurance plans? A little confused about how this works.

How am I doing/what can I do better with savings?,"So a little background on my situation. I’m 23, married. Right now my wife and we make 80k a year pre tax, starting in July next year due to promotions we’ll be making 96k pre tax. I have just under 20k in my 401k. Bring home pay right now is $5,200 a month. Next year it should be about $6,400. 

Right now we own a home, mortgage is $1,088 a month. Total housing cost is is about $1,400 for all utilities and HOA/trash fees. We have two cars. Mine is paid off and worth 11k. We bought her a new car in August, owe 18k on it but will be able to pay it off in June/July next year.  Payment is $316 a month @ 2% interest. That car is brand new so we’ll be able to keep it for a long time once it’s paid off. Once it’s paid off I’m planning on selling my car and getting something new. Put whatever I get for it down and finance the rest. Probably 20k financed. The payment should be about the same as the one now. We go on 3-4 nice vacations a year. Nothing too expensive. We go out and do stuff but aren’t in the club every weekend. 

I contribute 5% of my pretax pay to my 401k. I had an IRA previously with 10k in it but had it moved into my 401k. After all bills and fun spending we save around $1,500 a month in our checking account. So once we get our raises and pay the car off it should be about 3k a month piling up. 

My question is, is this being financially responsible? I feel like we spend too much most months. Family and friends say we’re doing great but I still have that nagging feeling. 

Also I’m pretty clueless when it comes to 401ks. What could I do with it to maximize my return? I just put the money in there and have done nothing with. Also next year when we have that extra free money every month, what is something I could do with it? Just watching it accumulate in the checking account is nice but I feel like I could be doing more.

[Debt] Rental property and personal home with a lot of equity. 10k CC debt. Tenants frequently late.,"Long story short I was put into a position where I had to take care of a family memeber due to their health failing. I move in with them over 2 years ago and had roommates at the time at my other house. Not thinking it would be a long term deal i didn’t have them move out until it was clear that I would not be returning, which was about a year later. During that time I racked up about 5k in CC debt, managing the bills at the other place and buying food and other necessities for my family member. The family member offered to sell me their house at a great discount. Between both property’s i have well over 150k in equity. But now due to a shitty tenant and other things popping up, my CC debt is racked up to 10k now. It is maxed and when my tenants are late I had zero money which is right now. I’m trying to think of things I can do to buy some time until I can sell one of my properties or get new roommates once my family member goes into assisted living. The money she acquired from the sale is put away so there is no using any of that. Any suggestions? What can I do with HELOCS? I’m assuming I should at least pay off the CC with that?? I have roughly 3-4 more months before the FM is in assisted living. My tenants are 10 days late, their lease is up in Jan and I have like $24 to my name.

What to say at doctor’s office to make sure insurance covers procedure without future plan implications?,"Hello Reddit, 

I’ll try to ask this question without going into much of backstory. It’s no big deal, just some chest pain I want to investigate and go to a cardiologist or family doctor to get an Echocardiogram ordered. I know it’s most likely nothing serious, more over I can probably guess what it is and I’ve been monitored for years up until I got to the US, where I can no longer afford to do that. I haven’t been able to do an Echocardiogram for a few years now as opposed to doing it once a year.

Problem is I can’t pay for it out of pocket. I have an individual plan, insurance, provided by my university through United (I’m not a citizen yet). I need to make sure my insurance can cover this procedure from one of the places in town.

I’ve read an article on costhelper.com that says *“An Echocardiogram typically is covered by insurance when ordered to help diagnose or monitor a heart problem but not as a routine screening test. For example, United Healthcare covers it for diagnosis and monitoring of a range of heart abnormalities in adults, but does not cover it for screening in the general population, including athletes with no symptoms of heart disease.”*

So that makes me question this process. I’ve been wanting to do it for months now this year, but wasn’t able to. What do I need to say or do at the doctor’s to make sure it falls within that category? Also, how do I make sure that it doesn’t affect my future plan cost and associated fees? I **do have** some medical info and previous Echocardiogram results from previous years, not in English though (maybe one?). And I also **do have** a good family doctor who may or may not be able to order it at my request (he’s out of town, I might have to go to someone else). 

I’m afraid to tell anybody about my previous screenings and condition so that my insurance will automatically assume I have a heart problem (which is not exactly a case, there are technicalities) and have them forever ramp up my premiums and future coverage. I do not intend to do another one anytime soon though, I want to do this one as a one time thing to make sure no bad dynamics. I also don’t want anyone else to know to whom my insurance might sell or tell my medical history.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7k52nl/what_to_say_at_doctors_office_to_make_sure/,1513398749,personalfinance

"How to take advantage of all the retirement accounts? 403, 457, Sep-IRA, 401k, and individual IRAs. Please advise.","I am a big fan of the Reddit PF community. I learn a lot of new stuff every day and I’ve got some great advice from this community. I need your advice again on the retirement accounts. As the economy is booming, our business and jobs are at peaks of earnings and we are clueless on how to take advantage of the retirement accounts. Our incomes is not consistent, some years we would make &gt;200k some years we will make &lt;50k. Me and my wife started a part-time business (SMLLC as wife as the sole owner) together this year and it is doing well. Through the business we are expecting an income of 140k next year. We have opened a Sep-IRA account but did not contribute anything to it. Apart from the business we both work on regular day jobs. My wife works for a university 60k which has 403k and 457k accounts. They match 10% on 5% contribution, so she maxes it out with her 5%. They don’t allow her to contribute more than 5% to that 403k account. She is not contributing anything to the 457k. I work for a medical company and make 140k. My company matches 4% on initial 5%. So I am contributing 5%. We both have individual IRA accounts. Since our wages are higher than the limit, we are doing back door ROTH conversions on both. So my question is, how can we maximize the IRA contributions? Should we make max out all 457, Sep-IRA, 401k, and both our individual IRAs? Also, can she contribute to all 403, 457, individual Ira, and Sep-IRA accounts? 
403k – Max 5% – No choice

Sep-IRA – Max 35,000 (25% of 140k) – Contribution?

Recently getting tuition fees waived and need to know the best way to use the money I will get back.,"Hey PF!

So my father is a veteran and I got to a Cal State University. I am entering my 2nd quarter of my 3rd year and my dad just applied and got accepted for the veteran benefit program here. Essentially through his service I get my tuition waived entirely for the 2017-2018 school year.

As to why the previous 2 years weren't waived, my father did not want me getting college for free as he did not want me to take it for granted. I understand his reasoning regardless of if I agree with it or not.

My main question is that with what I am expecting to get refunded for last quarter and saved on this quarter, I should get back about $7,200 (give or take) and want to know the best way to go about using this money in a good way.

Right now I work part-time at minimum wage (18 hours a week at $10.50) and get about $650 a month as I have a portion of my money being put in a specialized account (kind of like a retirement but for student workers at my Uni that is transferable after I graduate). Currently I do not have rent as I dorm so it is included in my quarterly dues, so my monthly expenses boil down to my car insurance and phone bill (~$150 as my car is payed off). Beyond that, I live frugally and don't go out too often so I generally have $50-$100 left over each month after food and whatnot.

So the main options I am debating doing with this money is 1) putting all of it towards my debts (I take out about $5000 per year unsubsidized) which would almost pay off my loans as of right now, OR put a sizeable down payment on a 2011-2013 vehicle. Right now I have a fully payed off 05' Elantra which drives great, but the reason behind getting a different car is because my brother (17) has a car that is dying on him and he nor my mother can afford any form of another vehicle and my brother usually takes my sister to and from school/dance classes and himself to work while my mother works all day.

So I am only considering a car so that I can give mine to my brother to help my family out.

I know putting the money towards loans would be the smarter decision, however I feel helping my family would be the better short term decision if all goes according to plan.

However if there are better options that anyone sees fit I would love to hear it. Thank you all for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7kwjus/recently_getting_tuition_fees_waived_and_need_to/,1513720114,personalfinance

Triple charged for returned payment.,"The following takes place in Florida, US.

So I made a payment through an online payment system to send out my rent check. This system is the one picked by the landlord. At the beginning of the month I made a payment which resulted in an overdraft that at my bank's discretion was returned (it was overdrawn my only 35, bank still declined rather then fee me) . My bank charged me a returned check fee. My landlord also attached a $40 returned check fee. on top of this my bank just got hit again by the online payment system for another $25 for a returned check fee. Are there any rules or laws regarding how many times financial institutions can charge multiple parties on the same incident, as well as weather my landlord can charge me a returned check fee on top of what their third party system charges.

Because the payment was returned, I had to hand over a cashier's check which included the $40 returned check fee and a $70 late fee, as the returned check did not come back until after the rent was due.
This one returned payment has caused me $170  in fees. This seems completely egregious and I am trying to understand if there are any policies in place like there are for credit cards that prevent you from overcharging/double charging late/returned payments.

After speaking to the bank about the whole matter I did get their returned check fee returned as it was the first time I have had something like this happen.

Best way to calculate federal tax owed?,"After partially doing my taxes I changed withholding to less because I was expected to get $900 back. After adding 7k in unearned income, my refund went down to $89. So I should’ve left as is. Starting in October I went back to 0 and am having an additional $10 a week deducted for federal taxes (im paid weekly). 

My work was bought out so between my companies I’ve paid

4,112.69 Federal income tax (expect 333.90 more)

2,367.67 OASDI (143.73 more)

553.7 Medicare (33.60 more)

705.07 FSA (81.24 more)

11.57 vision (.69 more)

30-40 workers comp (4 more?)

370.46 401k
With my job I’ve made 39,678.21 and will make 2400 more (minus those deductions) plus 8-9k unearned income from my tribe. I think this is counted by tribal gains? It is a per capita check and usually $400 federal income tax is with held. 

I’ve tried a few different calculators with drastically different results. Next year I am only withholding $10 a check in benefits rather than almost $30. I’d like to stop the additional $10 if I can. I don’t expect to be with the same job the entire year but do expect to be making about the same if I leave. 

So did i really fuck up my withholding and should I start saving or am i safe to stop with holding the additional $10 now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7ja4yx/best_way_to_calculate_federal_tax_owed/,1513077997,personalfinance

"How to choose an accountant for taxes, and how much to pay?","This year I will be paying someone to do my taxes for me. I've always done my own taxes using free software and paid nothing.

I may just do this one time, and continue doing my own taxes in the future using this year's taxes as a guideline.

I looked in my neighborhood facebook group for recommendations and found one that lots of people recommended. I emailed them and they said they usually charge $350 but were willing to come down to $300 since it's my first time.

Pretty down on life - could use some advice,"Hi,
This bridges personal finance, career advice and general life advice to some degree. Apologies for the conflation.


I currently live in an expensive city, in a small apartment with my wife, infant and animal. We moved here for my job while my wife was taking time off of work to be with our child. She just recently began working again and makes a good salary/likes her job.


My job is high paying but is absolutely horrible. I work an enormous amount, deal with a tremendous degree of stress &amp; politics and am the beneficiary of horrible decisions by executive leadership. I have gained a ton of weight. Family and friends are remarking on how stressed I seem. Even my employees have expressed concern about my perceived stress level. In short, I am not sure it is wise to hang on. This is not normal for me so I don't attribute this to any underlying issue. The job really is THAT bad. I think there is a significant chance of a layoff over the next year which would generate a generous severance package.


We are also miserable in our little apartment. There is not enough space and we are starting to think about things like where our kid will go to school. Buying a house is not a small investment where we live although we are actively looking.


My wife feels she needs to stay in her current role for 1.5-2 years minimum. Neither of us are in love with our current city.


The good news around all of this is that we have socked away a bunch of money. We set aside about 400k in cash in case we needed to make a down payment in a house and have about 500k non-liquid in retirement accounts and a taxable brokerage. Given our salaries, we are able to save about 10k post-tax each months while maxing out retirement accounts. We also bank our bonuses which can be substantial in the early spring each year.


Clearly the smart move is to try to hang on to my job until I get laid off or my wife is freed up to move to a more desirable location so I am not sure exactly what I am asking. I simply don't know if I can make it. Perhaps I just need a shoulder to cry on but would be interested in any advice from the community.

What advantages are there to a pension vs saving your own money?,"EDIT: I like in the UK, but may move countries in the future.

Assuming you're capable of saving your own money.

To my understanding pensions are protected by bankruptcy. They're a set amount that the goverment promises to pay you. Your employer may have to add an additional amount depending where you live.

You get more back than what you put in originally, after a set number of very long years.

Now what concerns me is the fact that whenever there's a economic crisis, the pensions are always the first thing that the goverment cuts back on. Assuming numerous slashes to my pension, how likely is it that I'll get any reasonable gain vs saving up my own money?

Why is my escrow shortage amount more than twice the amount of the increase of the property taxes.,"We received notice today that we have an escrow shortage of $2034.36.  Our city taxes increased by about $994 so we were expecting a slight shortage, the mortgage company is asking that we pay an additional $1244.34 to maintain a minimum balance in the account.  So here’s my question, when we purchased the home I’m assuming we opened the escrow account with this minimum balance.  We’ve lived here 3 years and previously owned a home for 5yrs and shortages have always been equal to the amount of increase in property taxes, why is this being considered a shortage now?

My credit score is not god awful right around 647/650
But I have went around to some different sites and local credit union to secure a loan for consolidation purposes. But I’m always denied or told I’m eligible for like half the amount I need. 

So are there any companies that will help out with a $16000 loan for consolidation? As long as my apr isn’t over like 20% I’m okay with it just need some options here.

[2017 Tax Advice U.S.] Higher bracket due to RSUs,"Hi everyone! I would like to hear your advice as well as things to know and tips and tricks for someone in my situation this year.

My wife and I file jointly and this year (with the stock market growth) we have sold a lot of RSUs within short-term capital gains period that quickly placed us on the 28% tax bracket. Despite that, my wife also recently lost her job due to layoffs and will remain unemployed for the time being as she has been unable to find a new job. We have no children and are under retirement age. 

Our income so far has consisted of regular salary income and small employer RSUs vesting and it has been relatively straightforward to calculate taxes ourselves. This is the first year our income has climbed to the 28% bracket and normally it is closer to mid-low 25%. While we are doing well financially, we also want to prepare for a scenario where my wife cannot find a job in the short term.

We are uncertain about next year and cannot be sure where our income levels will be. I doubt we will be at this higher income level.

What are things we should keep in mind while filing taxes for 2017? 
What are things to keep in mind for 2018?

Can we take some of our RSU income and contribute it to a 401k plan to take advantage of tax deductions?

College refuses to give me a paper bill,"So, I'm not quite sure what to do here. Preface: I dropped out of college due to health / mental health reasons tied in with the fact that my chosen career is now something I can't do any longer due to health reasons. 

I technically owe the college around $800 in fees and I'm aware of this, however I have a trust that handles all of my school fees. The college knows this, and thus I have requested a paper statement sent to my home (or, preferably, to the trust company that they do have the information of) so that I can go through the process of cutting them a check / going through the trust.

The problem is, they have ignored me at every juncture. They refuse to send me a paper bill and are requesting I come in so that ""This can be an opportunity for you to return to school and complete your academic goals. If you are out of school less than 6 months and you return, your loans may be eligible for an in school deferment. If you are already in repayment and have not defaulted on your loans, you may be eligible to return and apply for an in school deferment as well.""

Even if I wanted to come in within the 10 days they just gave me, with the 'polite' threat of collections, I can't. My wallet was stolen, I've got no credit card to give them, and I'm across the country right now for Christmas.

What the heck do I do? Should I call my trust company or should I try and keep telling them that I am unable to pay them without a paper bill?

My parents don’t know much finance-fu and so I came here to look for advice on where I would be best served to put the money. 

I am a freshman university student and have had most of my year’s tuition paid for by financial aid, with my parents helping support the rest. Due to a higher family income, I will be getting an on campus and summer job to try to come up with the $10k increase in expected family contribution for next year’s tuition, and it’s fair to assume progressively more will be required for each of the remaining two years. It may also be important to note that I plan on trying to go to Law school after these 4 years. Also, I have no savings, no debt, and no credit. 

I would like to treat the money as though it’s not even there and put it somewhere that I can get the most out of it, whether that be investing, or savings, etc. I have little prior experience with this sort of thing. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Also, my siblings are all under 18 and I’m wondering what would be best for them as well, as my parents simply suggested them putting it into a savings account. They are all directly being written checks to avoid it going through my parents and looking like income...(?) I don’t know how it all works, I’ve just had a few small conversations with my mother about it. I would just like to know what my options are so I can confidently make a decision. I know $1000 isn’t the most money, but it’s the most raw capital I’ve ever had at one time (lol). 

Thank you!

Fidelity sent me a check for an old retirement account. What should I do?,"Hi everyone! I appreciate you taking the time to read this! I am almost completely ignorant when it comes to retirement planning and savings, so I hope that I'm explaining everything correctly.

About 3 years ago, I decided that I no longer wanted to work in an office anymore, so I quit my job to follow my dream of being a teacher. While I was with my last office job (which I worked at for about a year), I had been contributing to their ""Employee's Incentive Savings Plan"", which I'm assuming was a 401K.

When I left, I completely forgot about the account. Yes, I know, stupid.... but I had probably only been putting about $40/month away, and my new teacher job has me putting away about $500/month, so the thought of this account just fell by the wayside. 

Yesterday, I received a check from Fidelity for about $450. I didn't get any heads up or anything, it just showed up. The account had been valued at $575 and had had about $125 in taxes taken out. Under the ""tax reporting"" heading, the full $575 is listed as Total Distribution, Total Taxable Amount, Ordinary Income Amount, and Eligible for Rollover.

I'm not hurting for money by any means. My wife and I have $100,000 in student loan debt, but $0 in credit card debt. We have a mortgage that is very affordable for us and we live very comfortably, so I am in no way in need of this money, nor do I plan on blowing it.

So now I have a few questions:

* Since $125 in taxes has already been taken out, will I still get taxed again on this come tax time?
* If so, is there a way to avoid this by rolling it into my Teacher Retirement?
* Since it's only $450, would it be better to just deposit the check and throw it at debt (student loans, etc)?

Thank you so much for taking the time to read this! I look forward to your response!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7l37ml/fidelity_sent_me_a_check_for_an_old_retirement/,1513793776,personalfinance

How aggressively to pay down student loans,"Long story short as im a little toasty as writing this - 

Teacher student loan forgiveness came through.  Sold some not-well-performing-gifted-by-aunt-bonds per PF advice.  Student loans are now down to a manageable &lt;$4k at 3.28% (3 loans varying ~1.1k-1.55k). Will toss another couple hundred after january to make them round numbers.

Im a teacher in Texas grossing 58k-ish a year.  I have ~6k in emergency fund (truck tires are expensive).

After primary and secondary bills I have ~1.1k to spend on upkeep for the month.  Generally +/- 100 bucks per month left over.

How aggressively do I pay these off?  I cant wait to be done with Navients asshattery however at this interest rate is it super beneficial to pay them down within the year if possible? 

Im not willing to wreck my emergency fund to do it but I am willing to fund my vanguard account a little more per month instead of paying them off quicker.

What should you do if you receive a large inheritance from a deceased family member?,"My grandmother spoke with me and my sister on Christmas about what is going to happen after she passes away(our grandpa said before he died that the house is to be left to my sister and I). Please don’t think I went up to her on the holiday and asked about it, our family is just really open about stuff and she has come to terms about her death and just wants to plan out what’s gonna happen with the house. She said that she’d like us to have the house but to obviously hold on to as much of the items in it as possible. She’s also had the house appraised already and it’s the appraiser rated it over 800k not including the surrounding property(large garden and a couple large yards). So what I’m wondering is if we decide to sell the house, and we split it, what would be a good course of action following receiving the funds? I considered stocks/bonds/crypto but it’s up in the air right now and I don’t want to put all my eggs in one basket. My sister and I agreed with our grandma that we don’t want to live in the house and that we would rather have our own homes. Not looking for judgement on our decision to sell the house, just advice on what to do if we get that far, with the large amount that we would both be receiving. My sister has a family and house of her own now and I live on my own in an apartment with my dog, no wife/kids

When is it ok to walk into a bank and deposit into an account that isn't your's?,"My landlord accepts rent via Popmoney or ""other methods of electronic payment"" but just informed me an hour ago that they can't accept payment via Zelle. They told me I can either ""make a direct deposit at a [bank] branch tomorrow (with no late fee) or pay by Popmoney"" and sent me the account and routing number for the management company's account. (It's from their regular email address and I checked that this is the same account number they gave us on the ""Wire Transfer Information"" page when I signed the lease, so I think it's legit.)

Given the ambiguity in the email, I'm a little afraid they'll try to charge me a late fee if I initiate a Popmoney transfer now and it takes another 3 days for them to get it. So if I choose option one, how does that work? Do I just fill out a deposit slip as if it were my account? Would I be technically breaking any rules?

High Yield savings account options,"Hello,

I’m looking to open a HY savings to make better use of the $30k sitting in my local savings account making 0.05% it’s getting now.  Problem is there are so many choices...

I’m looking for a reliable company that will allow me to easily direct deposit from my normal checking at my local branch.

The three I considered were:

American Express - all around good, but lower rate of 1.25%

Capital One 360 - better rate of 1.30% but only above $10,000

Barclays - 1.30% but reviews on the IOS mobile app are crap and I need a decent mobile app.

Are there any others to consider?  Or should I go with one of the above?  I’m a little nervous about moving my money to an online only bank (not as convenient to transfer, and just it being remote from my local branch) but the financial gain is too much for me to pass up.

Looking for opinions/input on whether or not it is fiscally responsible to purchase a home or continue to rent,"I am a nurse and earn around $65,000 a year.  I pay approximately monthly:
$1300 in rent
$200 in utilities
$200 in student loans
$130 in car and renters insurance
$120 in phone bill
$0 in credit card debt

And I bring in at least $3600 monthly after taxes.  (Because I'm a nurse, there is often overtime money I am excluding).

I live in Denver, CO and the rental and home buying market is rapidly growing.  I currently pay $1300 a month in rent and the only debt to my name is less than $8,000 in student loan debt (4 loans from 3.4% to 6.8% interest.)  My credit is also very good and above 810.  The downfall is I only have $10,000 in savings (Excluding $20k in my 401K).  I am more than qualified to get the amount I need for a mortgage, however I would not be able to put down 3% (let alone 20%) in a down payment (conventional loan) AND pay closing costs/fees.  I am looking into either:

1) borrowing about $5,000 from my 401K and having to pay back 5% interest
2) getting a loan for a down payment 

These tack on the mortgage insurance which is over $100 a month, as well as repayment of the down payment.  Looking at these fees I'm expecting an extra $100-$300 a month excluding mortgage, home insurance, taxes.  

I'm sure everyone is aware of the growth of the Denver.  I feel it is a smart time to buy because I could easily gain a lot of equity pretty quickly.  The thought is to then use that equity to get a better down payment for a better home in about 5 years.  In terms of combined monthly fees for home purchasing, I could afford about $1600 a month.  This could get me around a $200k home (give or take, and this is estimating about a $200 HOA fee) which is difficult to find in Denver.  This is also more than my current rent.

My question is: is it better to take the plunge (get a down payment loan or borrow from my 401K) and purchase a first time home, or to continue renting to build up a higher down payment?  I do not have the option of asking family or parents for financial help. 

I worry about being house poor or getting a money pit with the amount I can afford.  With it being a first time home, I'm not afraid of getting a cosmetically unappealing home as long as the ""fixing up"" isn't overly costly and it has good bones.  I also take into account that with buying a home, there will always be something that requires money to fix or upgrade.

Thanks for any advice.

Best option for bridge loan re home purchase?,"New job, new state. They’re letting me stay on campus (boarding school) until June. My husband and kids are still in original state so they can finish out the school year (over in June). They’re in 4th and 7th grade so that kind of thing is important for me. As for me, I’m staying in a single room and bathroom. No kitchen which is okay because I can eat out or in the cafeteria but not ideal for eight months. I’ve been here two months already. 

Anyway, we are going to put our house on sale in April so that closing date will be in June. Our house is primed to sell quickly (and we live in a competitive market area). We will get approximately 100K equity after the sale proceeds. Current house value is 450-460K. 

I’m really itching to move out to the new house in April or May so that I can have it all set up for the husband and kids when they move in June. That, and having our original house empty will make it quicker to sell. Husband and kids can live on bare necessities for a couple of months. 

The down payment on the new house would be approximately 100K. House would be approx 350K to 400K. I am not sure how we can get to purchase the new house before we sell the old home. A few options:

1) We Have approx 800K in retirement accounts (IRAs) and 40K in college saving accounts. We could borrow from those? Not sure how that works? 

2) We Have approx 10K in savings but we would prefer not to touch this since it’s our emergency fund. 

3) We would borrow 30K (at the maximum) by opening a line of credit on our current equity. 

4) we could just put down 5 percent down payment on the next house just to get approved, and then add the 100K as a simple principal lump payment two months later. However our mortgage payment would be higher if we do this since the amount we borrow with 5% down payment would be much larger than if we can make 20-25% down payment. I don’t want to get stuck with a high mortgage payment. 

5) Get a bridge loan. However banks do not seem to do this anymore for personal real estate purchases. 

Please advise (and be gentle). I’m sure there’s something I’m not thinking of. We CAN afford two mortgage payments for a few months. Our first house WILL sell fast and for the price we are asking.

Help understanding 401(k) rollovers,"Dumb question but I'm having trouble finding an answer.

What actually happens in a 401(k) rollover? Are the funds in my old account liquidated and then re-invested into the funds in my new account? Or are the funds themselves moved?

Example: Say Account X has a Vanguard fund with $20 and Fidelity fund with $10. Account Y has a T Rowe Price fund with $30 and a Blackrock fund with $5. When I rollover from X to Y, do I decide how my $30 in Account X (Vanguard &amp; Fidelity) will be allocated into Account Y (T Rowe Price &amp; Blackrock)?

Equifax Still Being Silly,"After months of not receiving a PIN number and learning that my address on file with them was totally jacked up, I finally got through to someone who could help. My experience with the customer service rep was kind enough and he/she was helpful for sure, but their security procedures for resetting and requesting a PIN after all of this time were laughable at best.

* They used the same information that was stolen to verify me
* Despite having successfully updated my current address by mailing them an ID and other information (they mailed the PIN to the previous address) because that was what I was told to do in order for the PIN not to be mailed to wrong place again, they never updated their Freeze system to reflect this. The agent quickly changed it based on my word alone.
* They gave my PIN out after asking some simple questions that anyone in the universe could answer.
* After answering one of the questions wrong, I was told I was incorrect and should try again and they would wait. I would have preferred to go through tougher or a lengthier process at this time. This would certainly give a would-be identity thief time to try other information.

So as the new year approaches and this thing starts hitting us, be very wary and monitor your stuff like a hawk. Don't even trust a security freeze.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7mhus1/equifax_still_being_silly/,1514409358,personalfinance
An idea about how to keep finances separate in a marriage.,"I have been doing a lot of thinking about how to split expenses in a way that is most fair to both my wife and I. After much discussion, we want to keep our finances separate as we believe that would mitigate a lot of possible arguments we otherwise would have about money in the future.

Because we make different amounts, I think that paying our shared expenses in proportion to how much each of us contribute to the total household net monthly income is the right thing to do.

So, she makes $15.50/hour and works about 25 hours per week. I earn $20/hour at 40 hours per week. This puts our monthly take-home at $4,417 (using an average number of weeks per month of 4.34524). Her take-home income accounts for approximately 33% of our net monthly income; mine, 67%.

Our shared expenses are $1,921. I propose she ought to pay 33% of that, or $634, and I pay the balance.

Here are some issues that may arise using this logic. For one, I expect to be earning at least $70,000 in 2 years whereas her income will likely remain flat. This, of course, would drive the proportion of our shared expenses I would be responsible for paying up and hers down considerably. Despite this, I still think that paying everything 50/50 is grossly unfair to her because it would constitute a much higher % of her income.

How do other married couples who wish to keep their finances separate handle this? Thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7k84su/an_idea_about_how_to_keep_finances_separate_in_a/,1513444205,personalfinance
Need help w/ savings plan/debt management for new year,"I dont make much and am trying to pay off some credit card debt right away and making some medium sized purchases while still putting money aside for savings and monthly expenses.

Monthly bills:

$120* - internet/tv (*will be changing in the new year and will have a discounted monthly price around this number for a period of time(i currently pay $180, and will pay this amount in jan for the month of dec))

$60 - cellphone (got that new 10gb for $60 plan, fuck yeah ����(Ontarios cellphone plans are normally $100 ish for 1gb))

$10 - netflix (or however much it is netflix charges now)

Debt:

Roughly $1500 - visa (my mothers visa, had to borrow from her for an emergency root canal. I dont have to pay it all back immediately but i want to make this priority one)

$1500 - visa (my own, my second priority)

$250 - old cellphone (owed $100 on current phone for getting it for free but left contract a few months early to get the above plan. This contract was $120/month. Its also my lowest priority cause cellphone bills dont affect credit scores until it hits collections (which takes a few months of no payments) and also because, fuck Bell.)

$750 - cellphone (in desperate need of a new cellphone as the one i have now is on its last legs both physically and internally. Also its my only means of communication and losing it will cause major problems, as such i personally put this as my third priority)

$400 - various weight lifting equipment�� (have about 50% of my ""home gym"" already purchased and set up.

"My wife woke me up saying ""i have no idea how much money we have.""","We've been banking with PNC for around a year at this point and have had no problem whatsoever. This last week has been strange, though. 

It started with our insurance bill. It's scheduled to come out at the beginning of the month, but it didn't show up at paid with our provider, and the transaction didn't show up with the bank either. So we made a manual payment. The next day (three business days later than it was supposed to be) the charge we made was there, along with a duplicate.

I called the insurance company to check that it was scheduled, an to see if they could refund one of the charges. But since they were still pending, I would have to either wait for them to go through or call PNC and cancel one of them. So I called PNC. The representative I spoke with told me that unless it was an emergency, we should wait a day to see if their delicate charge system catches it, and if not, to call back or dispute the extra charge online. So we waited. 

That's when we got to this morning. You see, the day when my wife was making a manual payment for our insurance, she also paid other bills. Now, none of those are showing up in the account. The original two charges for insurance are gone, but the insurance company has us listed as paid. Same goes for power, gas, and phone bills. 

I've been on hold for PNC for an hour so far this morning. I haven't spoken to a rep, so I thought I'd ask you all just in case someone has a bit more life experience than me and knows what the hell to do in this situation.

* Cell Phone: $100
* Cigarettes : ~ $200 (I need one vice to keep me sane, don't judge me lol)
* Grocery Money: $160 ($80 bi-weekly)
* Gym Membership: $52.50
* Transit: ~ $32
* Amazon Prime: $10
* Spotify: $10

Debts:

* AMEX: ~ $6000 (limit $6500, interest at 0% until May '18 I think, 19% or so after).
* VISA: $0 (limit $1200)
* PayPal: ~ $1700 (as they don't report to the credit bureaus, this is of least importance and I'll pay the minimum)

To provide some context before I lay out the finances, I am currently in the middle of a career change, working a temporary (6 month) position that pays hourly, so I do NOT have a retirement plan right now at this job. I am trying to move into higher ed admin, so looking to the future, I hope to be working at a university. This comes into account because my OPERS retirement from previous jobs may come back into play depending on where I get a job.

Here is what I can tell you:
OPERS (from a few student worker positions I had while in college) - $1,809.42 (as of 12/31/14, I can't find any more recent paperwork) 
TIAA (from a nonprofit gig I had but stupidly didn't pay into right away) - $1,202.32 (as of 9/30/17)
PNC (from the job I left in order to make this career change) - multiple investment options totaling $1,360.95 (as of 6/30/17)

Stock - current worth about $1,200, hasn't been going up or down all that much since it was gifted to me when I was born.

"(EU) I'm 21, have 40k in savings and no debt. What should I do with my savings?","Hi,
I'm 21 years old, have 40k in savings and no debt (huray for Europe). I'm still living with my parents and save about 2k a month right now I earn with my full time job, because I spend maybe 300 euro a month right now. Eventually, I want to buy my own place in Norway, but right now my money is just sitting in my savings account, probably losing value due to the low interest. 

So I'm looking for a way to increase the value of my savings, with my savings.

Questions with retirement &amp; savings,"Hi PF, I have been reading up on the wiki ""How to handle $"" and retirement planning but wanted to see what the community thinks on how to save money and get my retirement accounts cooking!  I just turned 29, got my bachelor's degree, and just started a new job.  While I was finishing my degree, I stayed with family and will be staying for at least a few more months, so I don't pay any direct rent.  Here is my income and expenses, per month:

* Income: $5,000
* Child support: $700
* Cellphone, Internet &amp; TV: $210
* Renters, Dental, Health, &amp; Car Insurance: $380
* Food, entertainment, gas, etc.: $900
* New car/house savings: $800

Here is my current debt &amp; savings:

* Installment debt (student loan): $500
* Revolving debt: $0
* TSP Account: $30,000
* Emergency Fund: $17,000

My employer matches 3% of 401k contributions so does anyone have any suggestions on the following?

* Put 10% of gross pay into a 401k
* Open and make monthly contribution of $458 to a Roth IRA
* Move $5,500 from savings and put into Roth IRA for 2017 

Edit: After proposed 10% 401k &amp; $458 roth contributions, I should have about $800 leftover which I would put away for future car/house savings.  Of course, once I get a place of my own, it would cost me about $800/month but I figured I would save it for now.

Edit2: Being 29, I feel like I'm a little behind on retirement. After 6 years of military, I have $31k in my TSP, which isn't much compared to some who have been saving for 10 years. The biggest plus is for me being virtually debt free. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7m5q81/questions_with_retirement_savings/,1514262914,personalfinance

Corporate credit card using my credit line?,"My office was in the process of setting up a corporate credit card for me when I confirmed that it would of course be using my company’s credit line, and they informed me that it would be using my information, and would be a line of credit using my score.

However having a corporate card means I would not be potentially running over my limit on my personal cards when I do business travel. Has anyone dealt with this? Is my company odd or is this standard practice?

Starting next year the combination of your state income and property tax deduction is capped.

"My mother wants to open a 529 account for my newborn, but I'm hesitant to give her my child's SSN","Hi, as the title says, my wife and I welcomed our first child on 12/04, and my mom wants to do what she's done for her 3 other grandkids and open a 529 savings account for my daughter.

I have no issues with this, EXCEPT.... when I was a teenager, my mom opened some credit cards in my name (without my knowledge) and maxed them out when she was in a tough financial spot (a common, sordid tale here on r/personalfinance).

That was many years ago.  The debt is fully paid off now, my credit score is now excellent, my mother's finances are back in order, our relationship is perfectly healthy.

When she first mentioned opening the 529 plan, I could tell that she was very hesitant and nervous to mention that she would need my daughter's SSN to open the account, as she knew that would be a red flag to me.  My siblings didn't see any issues with this when my mom opened 529's for their kids, but I was also the only one who had his credit dragged through the mud, she didn't open any credit cards in my siblings' names for whatever reason.

I appreciate my mom's gesture, and I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I'm less-than-comfortable giving her my daughter's SSN.

I'm also unfamiliar with how 529's work.  Could I theoretically open one of my own, in my daughter's name, that my mom could have access to and contribute to, without having access to my daughter's SSN?

College kids thinking about buying a house for grad school instead of continuing to rent for 4+ more years?,"So my boyfriend and I have been renting an apartment for the past 2 years while we finish our undergrad educations (both of us will be graduating in the spring). I have 4 years of vet school ahead of me here at the same school, and he is planning on a 2 year masters in the area as well, after which we aren't sure if we will be staying in the area or looking to move somewhere else. We have been considering buying a house here instead of renting because, based on our calculations, a mortgage (plus utilities and potential emergency costs) is a cheaper monthly option for the time we have here still and afterwards we at least end up with some tangible asset we can sell as opposed to just throwing the money away on rent with no payback. For reference, we currently pay about $800 between the two of us per rent each month, which is on the lower end for apartments around here, and we have found several houses in good shape and in decent neighborhoods for less than 45-50k - several are even around 30k. My parents have also previously mentioned providing some assistance with this if we ever decide to do it, since they did essentially the exact same thing when they were in school. Basically we're just wondering if this really is a tangible option  and if so, what steps should we take to prepare ourselves for our first purchase?

College student trying to eliminate student debt with current savings.

I already signed an internship offer for next summer that will pay about $7000 pre-tax, which I expect to pay very little tax on as it's my only income. That should cover most of next year's two semesters of loan payments.

"My Stepmom made a mistake on a check, and now owes $550+ dollars in overdraft fees.","I’m not quite sure if this is the place for this, but I need some advice regarding a banking issue. 

My stepmom on the first of every month sits down and writes checks for all her expected bills for that month electricity, credit card, etc and mails them out. 

This month she was writing a check to pay her credit card with Bank of America, she made a mistake.
She wrote the correct amount on the amount line ""One Hundred Twenty-Five Dollars and No Cents"" (the same amount she pays every month), but accidently wrote “1125” in the dollar box. 1125$ was taken out of the account. Bank of America refunded the difference after my stepmom called them, after realizing her mistake.

Unfortunately, in the meantime another of the other checks she sent out were cashed by other entities, and this led to a cascade of overdraft charges now totaling in excess of 550$. 

BB&amp;T (the bank my stepmom uses, and has used for 20+ years, and still has a legacy account of her late (first) husband that banked with them since the 1970s), said there was nothing they could do to remove the charges when she went and spoke to someone in person. According to the representative, she had already used her “overdraft reversal” (another unrelated mistake) for the year, and because it wasn’t a banking error, the charges would stand.

It seems ridiculous that a simple mistake on a check that no one noticed, that Bank of America was willing to reverse, is now going to cost her in excess of 550$?  Further still, I was under the impression that the written portion of a check overrides the numbers if the two conflict. An unbudgeted $550 expense is hugely problematic in an already strained financial situation.  Do you all have any advice for this situation? Is there any thing she can do about this?

Making tough decisions with my future,"I live in Dallas and am having serious transportation issues. I have purchased 6 cars in 2 years  (paying 1800-2200 per car).

 The cars barely last 6 months before I have a repair that I cannot afford so I get a payday loan to repair the car, get the car fixed just to have another issue.

I saved up 3,000 over one year without a car and the car I brought was vandalized and totaled. I did not have full coverage insurance.

I buy my cars off CL and mechanic shops and they all breakdown to quickly for me to put substantial saving together for a better car. 

I take the cars to mechanic shops for post inspections paying  $50 to $150 and get the green light but soon after use I need expensive repair. 

I am sure it's due to my 2 hour that's mostly gridlock during the mornings and night that puts excessive wear and tear on these cars.

35N going to Irving at 730am is absolute shit 

I spent a year without a car using public transportation for me and my kids (recent divorcee, special needs kids and challenge credit due to late paid and collection medical bills). The train was 3.5 hours to get them to daycare and me work.

Now, that they are school age it's no longer feasible. 

Advice I have gotten before and does not work

1. Move closer to job 
2. Use public transportation 
3. Save up and buy better cars
4. Get loan from.credit union and purchase vehicle

I have honestly tried all of them accept moving (I live in a safe affordable neighborhood). I cannot get an unsecured loan or auto loan from a bank.


I fear getting a car from buy-here (looking for car in 7k range) and having it break down then I'm saddled with a car payment and a huge repair expense.

I am now considering buying a car that is 2015 or newer. Using the car on the weekends for ride-sharing to assist in payments and getting it paid off as soon as possible.

I know a newer car I will allow more security and stability to continue working and providing for my family.

Because every time I have a car issue I am late for work which increases the probability of me losing my job at some point. 

Every time a car stalls out and needs repairs I have to pay for the tow for it to get off the highways, missing work and  paying for rentals and ubers.


Not having a reliable vehicle is seriously affecting the quality of life of me and my children.

I understand that a new car is one of the worst things a person can do for their finances.

The advice that they give to buy cheaper cars that I have been following seems to bring me closer to the brink of financial ruin.

I would just like some good advice on how to obtain more reliable transportation and not have it totally obliterate me financially.

I make about 40K a year after taxes. Better than many women in my situation. I just want to make the best decision possible.

(CH) My bank will start charging 0.6% negative interest on current and savings accounts. How to avoid?,"I'm in an unusual situation and I'm trying to find out what my options are.

I moved to Switzerland a few years ago. I just sold my previous business and plan to invest the money in a new business over the next 12 months. 

In the mean time, the money is sitting in a Credit Suisse retail savings account denominated in EUR.

Credit Suisse contacted me this week saying that they would start charging 0.6% negative interest from February 2018, for anything above 1M. This only applies to EUR accounts, not to CHF accounts. 

I do plan on exchanging about half of my EUR savings into CHF, but I'm expecting the exchange rate to rise, so I'd rather wait it out a little. 

CS has offered a temporary solution: The way I understand it, they would sell a 6 month call option to purchase half of my EUR for CHF. If the exchange rate rises beyond a certain price, I am forced to exchange my EUR for CHF. If it doesn't rise, I get compensated by about 0.6%, offsetting the negative interest rate. Either way, my savings would not shrink. 

Does that sound like a sensible deal? I am a complete newb when it comes to derivatives, so I can't really judge.

What other possibilities do I have? Any idea is appreciated!

PS. Yes I have seriously considered withdrawing the entire EUR amount in banknotes and storing it in a safe deposit box. But I just don't have the guts for that.

Questions regarding calculating tax &amp; possible deductions for consulting work,"I have a normal job, but I recently picked up a consulting gig on top. The consulting money is more than $10,000 and I'm wondering how to figure taxes on top of my regular income as well as figuring out what is deductible from that consulting money.

"Just started a new job, looking for some advice.","Hi r/personalfinance!

I'm 28 years old, and I just started a great new job making 130k. Here's where I'm at right now:

33k in my checking account

30k in a high-yield savings account (emergency fund)

13k in a Roth IRA with Vanguard

I have no debt, and my car is fully paid off and in great condition. My monthly expenses are about $4500. 

My plan for next year is to max out a 401k, backdoor Roth IRA, and HSA. Based off of my calculations, I'll still have some money left over every month, and I have all that money sitting in my checking account that I'm not quite sure what to do with. 

I'm worried about being behind because I only recently started saving for retirement and just switched careers, even though I keep telling myself I'm doing pretty okay because at least I'm debt-free.

As far as future plans go, I'd like to have enough to go traveling internationally once every other year. No plans for kids. I'd like to own a house one day, but I live in San Francisco so I know that's well down the line if it ever happens. I'd also love to retire a little early, but I'm not sure how feasible that is. Fortunately, I'm in a field where I can expect that my salary will keep growing.

Am I going in the right direction? What's the best thing to do to keep saving once I max out the tax advantaged accounts? From what I've read, it looks like a CD or index funds might be the way to go? What other options do I have?

Planning on moving into an apartment with a friend next year (college student) need advice,"Hello I'm a current sophomore in college at the moment and I need some advice and counsel about moving into an apartment next year (my junior year). First here is some background. I currently live off campus with relatives. It's relatively far from campus but only about a 15-20 minute bus ride. I've been wanting to move out and be closer to campus so I don't have to spend so much time in transit and going to campus out of class or being with friends isn't such an inconvenience. My friend is currently living with one of his buddies in an apartment near campus (directly next to the engineering part of campus which is where I'll be spending 90% of my time) but next year his friend is not going to continue with that current living situation. He asked me if I would want to move in with him and replace the current roommate next year. We went to the company that owns his apartment complex to get the process started a couple of days ago but they said before we could finalize it I would need to make a deposit of $510 (the rent is $500, not including utilities, per person). Apartments are fairly expensive over here and I'm willing to pay for the convenience. This is the problem: I don't have that much money at the moment and my parents will not be helping me with the apartment whatsoever. To pay the rent I plan on working during the year (along with saving money while starting a job here next semester and continuing my job back home over the summer). I'd be able to get the money to pay the deposit AFTER winter break from working at home. I could also get the money from a compounding interest account I have had since the beginning of my junior year of HS (approximately 3 years ago, $25 a month, compounding annually). I have recently contacted the guy who set up the account for me so I can see how much I have in there and to know the compounding rate and am going through that process currently. I'm aware that removing from this account would decrease my gain in the long run, and by a sizable factor. However, it is very important to me that I can finally move out and live my life (overly attached and protective mom, yadda yadda) as an adult. Is this deposit due immediately or am I able to wait until the second week of January? Should I take the amount out of the account to pay this (in my mind it isn't an actual monetary loss but a loss of possibility because the net gain would be positive regardless, just less positive)?

Ally Bank mistakenly shared my personal information...,"I was informed today by mail that Ally shared information mistakenly about one of my accounts by mailing the information to the wrong recipient.

While Ally does not believe my information was compromised, they did offer to pay for a credit watch service for two years. Here's where I am concerned now, Ally is offering me Credit Watch Gold 3-in-1 monitoring provided by.... Equifax, a recently and wildly untrusted monitoring agency.

I just checked my credit using CreditKarma, and did not find any red flags on there.

Has this happened to anyone here regarding their Ally accounts? Can I trust the Equifax Credit Watch Gold service, or should I expend my own resources on a different service?

Thanks for any insight!

Edit: 
So after 45 min on the phone with Ally (mostly on hold), I was told that the letter correspondence was indeed from Ally, and that my personal data being mailed to the wrong recipient was an isolated incident. I was told that the Equifax monitoring service was the best they could offer me.

Be careful using your debit card during this heavy shopping season - we had our bank card cloned...,"Hopefully I'm posting this in an appropriate place.

I am in the middle of dealing with someone ""cloning"" my wife's debit card and were successfully able to steal over $1000. The cloned card was used at a couple of ATMs and Walmart a few times.  The fraudulent transactions were ultimately caught by the bank's fraud department. Based on what the bank told us, the thief was able to duplicate the card and assign a pin number to it, but it was the fake chip that alerted the bank.  They were able to immediately know it wasn't their chip. Unfortunately, we have to wait until the transactions actually ""post"" before we can begin the claims process.

Here's the point of this - the bank told us that it's always best to use your debit card as a credit card. When you use those card readers and enter your pin, those machines have the ability to store you pin number. Which is why you sometimes don't need to use your pin (for purchases under a set amount).  The same is true at gas stations (which are notorious for fake card readers). Do you find it to be true that using your pin is riskier than running the card as ""credit""?

The bank also suggested that during the heavy shopping season (like xmas shopping) it's best to use your credit card. That way if someone is able to steal your money, it's not your liquid cash. I know that's risky since people (me included) have a tendency to spend a lot when using credit cards. Just be sure you can pay off the balance each month.

We were also told that the bank, or Walmart, most likely will not go after these people. I'd love to be able to know who it is and how they got our card. Mentally retracing our steps within the past few weeks we do recall the debit card being gone an abnormally long time while paying for dinner one night.

"The woes of automotive service, is this normal?","My current job has me signed up to make 31k a year.

Banker stuck me with a %15 percent personal loan when I went in for a home equity on the condition of getting a home equity to pay it off. Anything I can do ?,"Hi all,

I did something stupid. I never took a loan out before other than student loans and credit cards. I have excellent credit, but a ton of student loans.

I went to the bank to get a home equity loan on an investment property to purchase another property. The banker asked when my closing would be and I said it would be in 3 weeks. She said there is no way you could get the home equity in time because it normally takes 6-8 weeks. She then suggested that she had clients apply for a personal loan  and a home equity loan at the same time. She said they use the personal loan to bridge the gap till they get their home equity loan. So I filled out both applications. I received approval for the personal loan, and closed on the property. Now, the bank is rejected me for a home equity loan based off debt to income ratio. They are calculating my student loan payment at $1700 a month but I pay 245.45 under income based repayment plan. They said it doesn’t matter even if I get loan verification paperwork. The mortgage underwriter and staff do not contact me no matter how many messages I leave. The banker is actually really nice. She feels bad about the situation and it trying to figure out a way to help me. I would have never taken this loan is I knew they would have backed out of the home equity loan. Anytime I ask the underwriter how she calculated the debt to income and that it doesn’t make sense that it was acceptable for a personal loan and not a home equity loan she says the calculation is proprietary. She refuses to even explain it passed that. Is there any action I can take or did I screw myself? Thanks in advance for the help.

"Student loans are in the PSLF program, on an IBR plan, and payments don't even touch the interest. Also have a loan ineligible for PSLF. What do I do?","Throwaway because my other account has too much identifying info.

Background: I am in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF; after 120 monthly payments, my loans are forgiven) program for my student loans, and I have an Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. I'm a public school teacher, 27 years old, living in Ohio. My gross pay is $1,750 bi-weekly, and I take home $950 after taxes and deductions. I also just got married this year and I don't think I will even qualify for IBR with my spouse's income if we file jointly (he makes about the same as I do in terms of net pay). I had to re-file my IBR in April of this year, and since I got married in March I had to say I was married filing separately, even though that wasn't technically true since I was single for the 2016 tax year. Anyway, I was looking at my loan information the other day, which admittedly I haven't done as in-depth as I probably should have before, and I think I might be in a bit of a mess.

* Current total balance: $34K
* Unpaid principal: $33K
* Unpaid interest: $1K
* Direct loans: $28K (of that, $800 in interest; rates: 4.25% for subsidized and 6.55% for unsubsidized)
* FFEL loans: $6K (of that, $200 in interest; rates between 5.35% for subsidized and 6.55% for unsubsidized)

Though I thought the only loans I had were direct loans, turns out I have two small FFEL loans that don't qualify for PSLF, and since it is a much lower balance, it doesn't get as much of my payment as calculated under IBR. This year it was $80 a month total, and last year it was $120 a month. Of that $80, $20 goes to the FFEL and the $60 goes to the Direct loans. My payments under IBR are so small they don't even pay down the interest that's accruing. So for the FFEL loan, that leaves me with $6,000 to pay down after having paid basically nothing this whole time. I know it's my fault and I should have been more on top of this, but I need help figuring out what to do.

So my question is: Where do I go from here? Do I try to pay down the interest as much as I can on both loans or just one? Do I try to pay off the FFEL loan as quickly as possible since it can't be forgiven? I'm about 4.5 years into repayment, so if I combined the loans, I would have to start all over again, which I don't think would be beneficial. I can't afford to contribute all that much extra to these with my other expenses and my income level. I feel like there might be more to add regarding my financial picture, but I don't know if it's relevant, so I will add that info if need be. Sorry if this is kind of all over the place, I clearly have no idea where to begin. I'm gutted and I just feel so stupid. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: I didn't look at my student loans carefully enough and now I'm seeing my payments on an IBR plan don't even cover the interest. Also have an FFEL loan not covered by PSLF and have been paying basically nothing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7mv799/student_loans_are_in_the_pslf_program_on_an_ibr/,1514564176,personalfinance
"Student Loans, Help Appreciated!","Questions regarding student loans. I am a first generation college graduate, that being said, when it came to student loans we had no clue what we were doing. 

My parents are divorced and we’re both remarried at the time. They thought it would lessen the financial burden for all if they each helped and took out a Parent Plus Loan for my schooling. My Step-Mother took one out, my Dad took one out, and my Mom and Step-Dad took one out together. I also have my own student loans. Long story short, I now am responsible for paying on 4 separate loan payments individually. 

I’ve looked into ways of consolidating the loans, but have not had much luck as they are all in different names. I have come across the option of CommonBond that says it will take your parent plus loans and put them into one account. Which brings me to my questions:

1.  Has anyone else experienced a similar problem or know of a situation in which someone has?
2.  Has anyone used CommonBond and what is their opinion?

$100k to invest in Vanguard Index Funds too much for a risk averse person?,"EDIT:  Thank you all for your comments!  Just to clarify, I'm in my early 40s and married.  I guess I don't really need the money until I hit ""retirement age"".  I could technically put a total $200k but I do like to keep some very liquid (our house needs work - though that would come out of our joint savings acct).  The amount I mention are my own money from old savings &amp; my mom's inheritance (my husband has his separate investment funds, we have joint savings accts &amp; the kids have their own savings accts).

I think I will go ahead and put $100k into Vanguard index funds (with a portion going into the Wellesley) and eventually phase my other $100k in.  I will also look into what another poster said about rolling all my old 401k over to Vanguard.  
___________________________________________________________________________________________

I am wanting to open up a Vanguard taxable account before year end to invest some of my liquid assets.  I already have a Roth with them and make my yearly allotted contributions.  I am a SAHM so I currently don't have a work sponsored 401k (I do have several from old employments prior to kids).

Anyway, I am very much like my mom when she was alive...very conservative with my money...though I take more risk than her in terms of investing (she was a lover of CDs and had most of her money in them).  I have been thinking about investing a portion of my cash (currently sitting in an Ally savings acct) for awhile and finally decided to pull the plug.  $100k is what I'm thinking of sinking into Vanguard index funds but do you think that's too big of an amount to start with?  Maybe I should just do $50k?  The money I have is not earmarked for anything atm.

Any advice would be much appreciated!

"Job not as described... Does this constitute ""bad faith?""","I have been in an engineering position for just over two years now. I have known for a while that it was not going to work out. One reason (among many) is that I was recruited by a senior engineer who I was hired to replace. He retired a short time after I was hired. However, it was clear after a while that his superiors intended that I would fill a different role than how he described his job to me. He was a 40+ year veteran who defined his role differently than my superiors do. They were present during the first interview but he did most of the talking and took me for a two hour tour alone. 

I plainly asked this question to my current department head during last year's performance review, and he confirmed my suspicion and didn't seem at all worried about it.

401(k): Traditional vs Roth?,"24, graduated last December and started work in February, new to the game and looking to learn more about retirement saving. The general advice I see here is to:

1) Max employer contribution to 401k

2) Pay off high-interest debt

3) Max Roth contribution (5.5k in 2017)

4) Max traditional contribution (18k in 2017)

My question is: Why is Roth prioritized (in general) over traditional for workers under the cutoff for Roth contributions? 

I understand the sentiment for Roth that you take advantage of a lower tax bracket now with the idea that in the future you'll be in a higher tax bracket. I'm not sure the numbers make sense to me though. 

Intuitively, I would expect that the larger pre-tax contribution now would have compounding gains that would out-weigh those of a smaller after-tax contribution now with no taxes later. At this moment, I pay ~30% combined federal/state/county income tax (assuming new senate bill values). Based on my career goals, I could reasonably expect to reach ~33% and could reach as high as ~40% (though not as likely as staying in ~33% is) at max expected income. If I'm effectively investing 30% more due to pre-tax contributions into traditional 401k, I'm not sure how even worst case (40%) tax on it later would make a Roth IRA worth it. Surely the compounding gains on a larger account would more than make up the 10% max difference in taxes paid, much less a 3% difference?

As part of my culture, I am welcome to stay until circumstances change, and am even encouraged to so I can save money (God bless my parents).

Financially, it may not make sense to give up all the monetary perks away, but I really feel like I am missing out on certain life skills by staying in the care of my mom. I don't stress my mom out, she actually likes entertaining and caring for me.

Loans vs Home,"My husband and I are both attorneys, he makes $80k (plus 6k bonus last year) and I make $130k (plus 10k bonus last year). His company pays for health insurance and it's super subsidized, last year we had a baby and paid about $500 out of pocket. He puts away 6% of his income in 401k and I put away 4%. His company matches at 6% and throws in an additional 3%. Mine matches 2%. We put away $300/month in our savings on an ongoing basis. I have a decent budget going, and we don't spend on frivolous items, except the occasional treat. 

Sounds great so far except here is where the picture stops being rosy - I have over 300k in student loan debt and he has about 150k govt and 70k private loans. We also live in a super high property value state, where just to live in a decent school district, we shelled out $550k for a starter home. We are both on income based repayment but still pay about $2200 together in student loans a month to govt for both our federal loans and $600/month for his private loans, while not even making a dent in the govt loans. His private loans are refinanced and will be paid off in 9 years. Our mortgage is $3450. Miscel expenses add up to about 4k (cars, food, gas, fun). We essentially live paycheck to paycheck, with no money to spare at the end of the month. I have bills scheduled to a perfection so we never have less than 3k in checking. 

Here is what I need help figuring out - our property values have increased quite a bit from last year and our home is worth about $620k. We owe $540k on it (we used FHA to purchase). Should we sell the house and pay off our student loans before buying a home, and just rent for a few years and buy once we have paid down the loans in about 10 years? I'm wondering if we made a mistake buying a home while having student loan debt. Does it make sense to count on the equity of a home going up to try and use it to pay off student loans in a chunk? 

Our plan is to wait for 5-7 years, hopefully have the equity in our home go up by 100k or so, and pay off all his federal loans in a chunk, wait another 10-12 years and repeat with mine. Essentially we would add to our mortgage (hopefully at a lower rate than the average of 6% interest rate that our loans are at) and borrow against the house to pay off the loans little by little.  

I doubt we will get to a point where our loans would be forgiven because we don't work in public sector. The reason for this type of payment is we lose income based repayment if our income debt ratio exceeds a certain amount so we have to be careful losing that IBR status. 

Should we stop contributing to 401k and pay down student loans (this isn't really that much money, certainly not enough to pay off loans as a whole but may put a little dent in it). 

We have a safety net / savings of about $20k, but that's it. My 401k has $12k and his has $14k. We graduated law school 4 years ago, no jobs before then. We have about 25k in credit card debt (0% and 2% interest rate that we are making monthly payments on for dental work, furniture and a couple of house projects we borrowed for). We are both 30 if that helps. We won't have childcare expense until after about a year, but daycare will be another 1.5k/month.

Questions about gift tax and filing,"My partner (we are not married) is on  disability for medical reasons and does not currently work.

Now here's where I'm looking for advice.  She hasn't filed a tax return for about 15 years since she has been sick/disabled. She is very frugal and this savings was not earned income.   

Does she file a return to declare the 14k for 2017 as well as the lifetime exclusion in 2018 ( 14k gift plus 22k lifetime exclusion)?   is the declaration/ filing of the first 14k even necessary?

How bad is this car loan rate?,"I was looking to buy a new 2018 Honda Accord. When it came to financing though they offered 5.39% for 72 months, 5.34% for 60, and 5.29% for 48 months. That looks really high to me, especially since my credit is great.

I applied online with BoA and they sent me a loan approval for just under 3%, but the dude at the dealership said that they'll probably readjust the APR after getting the bill of sale and seeing the exact model. He said the high rates are because of how brand new the model is. Is that complete bullshit? He also said I could just take this rate and if I find a better one it would be simple to refinance. I know nothing about refinancing auto loans, is it as easy as he says?

I ended up telling them I have to think it over tonight and put the deal on pause.


Edit: Thanks everyone for the suggestions and info.

Finding the lowest rent in winter months,"I am a Boston resident and looking to rent (1 bedroom) in the greater Boston area. I found some good deals with fairly low rents with the first month free. Is December or January generally a better time to find a better rate?

My situation:
There's an apartment building that I have been looking at that I fell in love with. However, the leasing agents have been a bit unpredictable. They tell me apartment rates and deals are generated by management on a daily basis and specials on apartments can be pulled or listed at anytime. I was told it depends on the demand for apartments. For example, an apartment ""deal"" was listed for $1500 which got snatched up quickly (I tried to take it but did not get there in time), but now (2 days later), similar apartments in the complex are going for $1650+. There is no room for negotiation, no timeline for how rates are expected to change, and very little transparency. The building is having a special now for a free month of rent, but the rates are a little high. I am unsure whether I should act now or take my chances waiting on a better deal in this complex. This is considered a luxury building with great amenities. I would love to live here. In summer months, rents approach $1900. This is my first rental and I am very confused on how to approach this.

Buying universal life policy to replace term life policy after heart attack?,"
I am so beyond confused right now because this decision would be a big one in terms of how much money my husband and I would be spending over the next 30 years. 
Here's our current situation: 

Combined (bring home) income $250k year
We have 4 kids.
No debt, expect small mortgage. ($350k) 

I had a 10 year term life insurnace policy and it just expired so I just got a new 20 year term life policy for 3 million. I'm 38 years old. I'm super healthy.

My husband has a 3 million term policy as well, but about to expire in a couple years. He had a heart attack about 3 years ago, so a new policy would be too expensive. But we have a ""conversion option"" on his current policy.  We are considering now ""converting"" that 3 million into a universal life policy for ever. It will cost us about $16k per year. He is 47 years old now. 

He retires in 7 years. His pension will pay out about $12k a month. Its taxable. If he takes a pay down on that of $1800 a month when he dies, I get about 60% of that, (still taxable) after he dies.

Our insurance guy is saying that if we take the full pension benefits, then we use the money that would have gone to down the pension for my benefit to pay into universal life, we will come out way ahead. 

worst case scenario, let's say he lives to 80, my max payout would be $548K, but its a guaranteed death benefit of 3 million. (which I'd like to give to the kids) 

Also, the insurance guy says that at any time we can cancel the policy and get most of our money back. 

I'm looking at the application now and its called a UNIVERSAL LIFE WITH INDEXED OPTIONS. With Brighthouse/ AXA/

From everything I hear, I feel like it's a good move. But I feel like something is fishy with this..

Bad Credit but Currently Have Healthy Income - High Interest Pre-Approved Credit Cards Worth It?,"I'll make this short and sweet, as the title tells most of the story.  

I'm currently in my 30s with bad credit (~500) due to student loans I let slide into default in my mid 20s, while I only had a part time job and irresponsibly fled from the debt rather than addressing it.  I'm better now financially, making ~75k per year and steadily paying down my debts.  

Unfortunately, due to my past, I can't seem to get a normal credit card through normal means, and I'm struggling to rebuild my credit.  I have a secured credit card with a $500 limit that I pay off each month and have done so for the past 14 months.  Even that was declined to be upgraded to the real thing after the initial year, and it carries a $35 annual fee with no benefits.

I do, however, keep getting pre-approved credit card offers in the mail.  I'm aware the catch is typically ridiculously high interest rates.  They prey on the poor and end up gouging them for a profit if they end each month with a balance.  

**Simple question:** Is it a good idea to get one of these cards to help build my credit if I pay off the balance every month?

Brand new debit card compromised. What gives?,"Hey all!

Two weeks back, I decided to switch from a bank to a local credit union close to my home. Got an account set up, along with checks and a debit card in the mail last week.

I have not begun to use my new credit union account yet as I needed to get my direct deposit switched and take care of some automatic loans that were coming out of my bank account. My checks and debit card have been tucked safely away in my home since the moment I got them-- neither ever used. The only thing I did with my debit card was activate it over the phone once I got it in the mail.

As for account information, I did physically write my account information on a form and gave it to HR at my work for direct deposit. That's it, though.

On 12/9 and 12/12 of this month, there have been 3 fraudulent charges made with my debit card on Amazon.com. I only figured this out because I decided to check my online banking knowing that I was getting my first direct deposit check in today.

My credit union has reversed the charges and a new card has been issued, which is great. However, I can't shake that uncomfortable feeling as to how someone was able to access information that I've never even used yet? 

Anyone here deal with something similar? I feel like I'm going to be constantly paranoid once I get my new card...

TL/DR: Opened up a checking account at a credit union a couple weeks back. Haven't started actively using account yet and debit card/checks have been tucked away at my home. Someone still managed to get information and went on a small shopping spree on Amazon.com.

Why do I feel like I'm not saving enough?,"Greetings everyone. This is going to sound ridiculous, but I feel like I'm not saving enough money. Here is some additional information:

---------------------------
Overview
---------------------------
- 23 years old
- Live in Pennsylvania with my grandmother
- Work as a Systems Administrator
- Yearly Gross Salary: $53,508.00
- Monthly Net Income: $1,357.89
- Total monthly expenses: ~$500
- Savings/Emergency Fund Balance: $10,000
- No debt
- Relatives currently owe me $17,000 (I don't see myself getting that back though)

---------------------------
Retirement
---------------------------
- (Pre-tax) 5% of gross earnings into 403(b) retirement plan while my employer contributes 9.29%
- (Pre-tax) $1,500 per month ($18,000 yearly - maxed) additional contribution to 403(b)
- (Post-tax) $458.33 per month ($5,500 yearly - maxed) to Roth IRA


Even though I'm making decent money, minimizing expenses, and maxing out my 403(b) and Roth IRA contributions I still feel like I'm not doing enough. All of the things I'm interested in doing during my life are going to cost me a lot of money and I'm trying to do everything I can to save as much as possible. Aside from increasing my income (which I'm currently working on by obtaining my bachelors degree) how else could I possibly be saving more? Why, after everything I'm already doing, do I still feel like I'm not doing enough?

"Discuss career path with boss now, during year end review, or after?","I work as an IT business analyst, doing mostly software integration project management and participating in cross-functional teams.  Also acting DBA for our SQL servers, own the SCRUM board for our IT Requests (help desk tickets that are more than quick fixes) and manage our entire corporate reporting environment. I've been at my current job for about 2.5 years, like the people I work with and the company I work for.  In our hierarchy, I report directly to the VP of IT, along with 5 others - the only tier below is help desk.


According to Glassdoor, and multiple recruiters, I am fairly compensated for my position - however I feel that my title doesn't accurately describes the work I do or value I bring to the organization.  If I match up my skills to job descriptions, I feel I fit better into things like ""Enterprise Software Integration Manager"", ""Director of Business Intelligence"" or ""IT Manager"" and the like.  I was selected and sent through training for succession planning for VP of IT, with a bunch of other people I work with on a day to day basis - who all have Director or manager titles.


Undergrad is in Business Management, also hold an MBA. PMP certification test is in January.  Previously served on strategic planning teams in an IT capacity.  Currently serving in the military as an officer on the Reserve side.  So literally all my schooling and training has been managing people and projects.


For next year I was offered an intern as a direct report, for the summer, with no title change or pay bump.  I currently make less than both of the people who I direct day to day work for - even though they don't report to me.



Now for the ""feels"" - which is where my questions are - am I out of line in my thinking? 


I feel like I'm doing more than my job description, and functioning in a much higher capacity.  


I feel like I should be managing the people that I am directing work for, outside of my authority/capacity as a project manager.


I feel like I'm significantly underpaid for the benefit I'm bringing to the organization - and I can prove it mathematically using saving from the projects and software I have implemented.


I feel that with how busy my boss is, that the organization would be better off with another layer of management between VP level and lowest level.


I feel that if I am trusted with the most important IT projects in the company, it makes sense for me to have a higher position in the organization.


I feel like all my ""peers"" at the company have Director or manager titles, and direct reports, while I don't.



With all that being said, I'm not chasing quarters here.  The raise and promotion I'm looking for is on the order of 15-20%.  


Do I talk to my boss before my year end review, during it, or after it?  I'm not worried about retalliation or getting let go - and even if it did happen, I have recruiters emailing me 3-5 times a week, so I could get a new job quickly.


I posted here because it is salary negotiation, sort of.  If it belongs somewhere else, happy to move it.

"Issue with Chase Bank, they are incapable of completing and notarizing a form with info about my loan, form is necessary to keep tax credit","Sorry for the saga.

I bought a house in 2009 and qualified for a mortgage credit certificate (MCC), which  allows me to claim a significant tax credit ($47k by the end of the 30-year loan). My original loan was with Wintrust and was then bought by Chase. 

My interest rate was 5.125% and as rates dropped it starting making sense to refinance. I could keep the tax credit if I refinanced but could only claim as much of a credit as would have been allowed under the terms of my original loan. 

I would also have to submit some paperwork, including a notarized payoff form that Chase would have to fill out *after the refinancing was completed.* It is a very simple form, a pay-off certificate that states I previously had a loan there, the date I paid it off, and the amount i paid off. 

I was nervous about losing the credit if there was a hitch with this paperwork and went in person to a Chase branch *before my refinancing* to give them the form and ask if there would be an issue filling it out for me after I refinanced. 

The MCC program is not well known and the branch employee who assisted me was not familiar with it. He made a copy of the form and made some calls to the department that would handle such a request. I believe he faxed them the form and I was assured it should not be a problem to get this form completed.

I refinanced to a 15-year at 2.875% with another lender. After refinancing, I went back to the Chase branch and spoke to the same employee and formally requested that they complete and notarize the form and return it to me. He contacted the same department to get the ball rolling and they asked me to sign a third party consent form which did not make sense to me as I was asking them to mail me the form, not send it to anyone. 

The form is generated by the local Dept. of Planning and Development (DPD), as they administer the MCC program in my area so their name is listed at the top but it does not advise the lender to mail it to the DPD and the DPD address is not on the form, there is no address anywhere on the form. The instructions for the paperwork packet indicate it should all be sent in together. After pointing this out, Chase agreed I did not have to sign the third party consent form and that they would mail me the completed form. 

Instead of receiving the form back, I received a letter from Chase asking me to sign a consent form to release information to a third party, namely, the local DPD. Whatever. I decided to just go with it and contacted the person at DPD who handles this and she said Chase could send the form separately but to mail it to her attention. 

On Dec. 5th, I faxed Chase a very clear cover letter stating what I needed from them, a copy of the letter they sent me requesting I sign the consent form, my signed consent form, and yet another copy of the blank form I needed filled out. 

I called today, Dec. 19th, to check the status of this matter and was advised they cannot complete and notarize the form, only issue me a letter. I did not feel the person even understood what I really needed.

I asked to escalate the call and was passed to a person who stated they could not complete the form for ""legal and compliance reasons,"" only issue me a letter with the needed info. 

I asked him to look at the form and see it basically asks for the same info they are willing to put in a letter, it just needs to be notarized. He looked through the pages of my fax and said the only blank form in my fax was a consent form that i needed to sign. Frustration! 

I asked him to read the title of the form--which is *Pay-Off Certificate*-- and asked him how in the heck am I supposed to sign my own pay-off certificate? I asked him to read the first line of the form--""I, the undersigned, an authorized officer of ________(name of lender)--where it is very clear it is a form for the *lender* to complete. He still said they cannot fill out the form.

I advised him that, before doing the refinance, I had gone to a branch in person, given them the form and been assured that Chase could complete the form. Why did they agree to this and are now reneging? When they sent me the consent form to sign, wasn't that an indication that they would complete the form?

I did get very angry with him on the phone and told him if they cannot complete the form I will lose thousands of dollars that I would then sue to recoup from them. I asked to speak to his supervisor and was told she is not available and will call me back.

As a precaution, I submitted a request online for a payoff quote from Chase right before my refinancing date. By chance, the quote is dated the same day as my refinancing. I have e-mailed the person who handles this at Chicago DPD to see if that is acceptable. 

What else can I do? I am also up against the clock a little bit, the tax credit is on the chopping block under the Republican tax reform so this might be a moot point but I am hoping they will keep it or at least grandfather those who already have it. 

Because it is based on the interest I pay and I will pay much less interest with the 15-year, my tax credit won't be what it was before but it would still have been free money. Rates are up again so I don't regret refinancing but am annoyed that the precautionary steps I took to make sure I could keep the credit might turn out to be futile.

**tl,dr: Chase Bank cannot fill out and notarize a simple form I need to keep the tax credit I have.**

Update: DPD called me back, she said the MCC program survived tax reform efforts though bill is not yet signed by Pres. and she can try to work with me on whatever Chase is willing to issue, though she agreed it is nuts that a bank is refusing to issue a notarized document. Since she handles these refinances, I had asked her before refinancing if people found it hard to get their old lender to comply and she said no. So I'm going to send her my part of the paperwork and go in to Chase branch tomorrow in person to talk to that same employee, when I met with him he was very interested to learn about the MCC as he was in the market to buy and seemed to qualify himself. I gave him helpful links to information on it as there's not a lot of marketing of the program around here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7kvzib/issue_with_chase_bank_they_are_incapable_of/,1513715163,personalfinance

Should I pay extra towards student loan or set aside for emergencies?,"Hello,

I have a set budget per month so that all of my bills are paid on time. The only debt I currently have to my name are my student loans, which are at $14, 700. 

I am currently on an Income-based repayment plan, which is currently at $0 per month. I pay off any interest that accrues. 

After I set my monthly budget, I typically have some left over money, which I then set $200 aside for unexpected costs/emergencies and any other from that I use as ""fun money.""

My question- Should I pay extra towards student loans or set the money aside for emergencies? This will only be about $50 that I can afford to put extra into the student loans per month. Will this have an impact on my loans, or will the money make a greater impact elsewhere? 

Edit: Thanks for all the help. I think I will continue setting aside the $200 for emergencies and I will take some from the ""fun money"" and apply towards loans. If there isn't enough from fun, I will take $50 from emergency that month and pay the loan.

She can be a bit of an impulse shopper, is there anything I can recommend to her to bring that more under control? 

I am bringing home ~$4800 a month. I have around 5.5K of credit card debt that I know that I will be able to pay off before I get out, and I am also adding between $250-400 to savings each month. I have $2850 in saving atm.  What more can I be doing to help us be in a comfortable position next July, when I will have the Post 9/11 GI bill and maybe a side job as my only sources of income?

"Bought a Lemon of a vehicle, what are my options?","About a year and a half ago I bought a used VW from an Acura Dealership. This was the first vehicle I ever bought from a dealer, and was none the wiser why the salesman seemed so keen to get it off the lot. So I buy the car and finance through my credit union. Three months later the transmission goes out. The warranty was something like $3k so I hadn't bought it, and Lemon Laws only cover car buyers for 30 days in my state.

So I get the expensive repair, and two months later the tranny goes out again.

Can I afford a new (to me) Truck?,"Okay, so first, I appreciate the advice you guys provide. Thanks for reading this. 

My wife and I are married, with two kids (2 and 4) and make 155k household gross, in Iowa. We're both 34. We have a reasonable house that we plan to stay in until the kids go to college (bought in 2011 with 116 at 4% (non-variable), currently owe 90k) and I have about 10k (3.25%, non variable) in student loans. No other debt. I use a Chase credit card to build up points, but I pay it off every couple of days. My credit score is 817 and my wife's score is higher.

We keep around 5k in savings for emergencies, another 10k in vanguard investment funds (not 401ks). I have 40k or so in rollover IRAs at vanguard, and another 10 in my current 401k. My wife has around 70k in her 401k. We also have around 10k in various stocks – my wife's hobby.

We pay about 1k a month to the escrow on the mortgage and childcare for two (1900 a month, yikes), and I have to make a 90 dollar student loan payment. Obviously there are other sundries and expenses, but we live well within our means. We pay for groceries, car insurance, and internet – no cable or anything like that.

Three years ago I owed over 95k in student loans, thanks to a bunch of stupid choices in my youth, but after I got a new job a few years ago with a big raise, I pretended I was still making my previous salary and started paying around 2k extra (on top of the payment they made me pay) a month toward my student loans until I got rid of all the high interest and variable interest ones, which reduced my must-pay payment from over a grand a month to 90 bucks for those.

The plan, up until recently, was to keep powering ahead, and be basically debt free (including the mortgage) in around 3 more years or this strategy, because the student loans left such a bad taste in my mouth that I didn't want to owe anyone any money anymore.

But lately I've been thinking I should purchase a new vehicle. My wife drives a 2008 civic, which is a reasonable and safe enough car, but I'm still driving the 1999 Jeep Wrangler I bought 8 years ago. It's cold in the winter (cloth top), baking in the summer (no air-conditioning, cloth top), a 4-cylinder that can only get to 65 on the highway going downhill, and in general feels like a somewhat unsafe vehicle for the two car seats that occasionally get installed in the back (pain in the butt to strap kids in with a 2 door jeep). It shakes something awful on the highway as people buzz around me.

The house we bought is older, and I do a lot of home improvement projects, so I would love to have a truck. Paying delivery fees or bothering my brother is a pain in the butt. I've been looking 2015 Tacomas since it was the last year they made a V6 stickshift, (extended cab, so I can stick little ones in the back) which can be had in my area for around 25k. The thing is, even though I know I can clearly afford a 400 dollar payment every month with ease (my 2k extra to debt would drop to 1.6k, but that 1.6k would probably go to the truck loan anyway), I'm really having trouble giving up the idea of being debt free in three years. This would likely push it closer to 4 years, and while that's still reasonable, it's hard to overcome the feeling that I just ditched a bunch of debt and don't wanna take on more. 

Even if I save for the truck first, that would mean that I wasn't paying extra instead, so aside from the interest on the loan, it's basically the same thing. Am I being nuts here? I mean, I think I'm in a pretty good financial situation and I should just pull the trigger, but I have doubts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7kygmj/can_i_afford_a_new_to_me_truck/,1513738129,personalfinance

How much would it cost a student to live in Canada?,"I've been reading this sub-reddit for a few weeks now. I'm a student moving to Canada, and I thought I had everything covered.

Returning to Graduate school and defering undergrad loans .

"Read Prime Directive but it seems my steps are out of order, where do I start first or what to do I change?","Foremost, thank you so much for all of the helpful information in this subreddit. The Prime Directive information provided me with more direction,clarity and honestly an excitement I needed to really stay driven on tackling this debt. However, that being said, it seems I have some steps out of place. Can someone provide me with more direction on how to get a tackle on my debt while creating a savings account? Also, If I'm extremely focused is it possible for me to have all debt paid off within a year and a half? (Would ideally like to have no debt for baby #2) 

Here's the breakdown: 
My monthly income if it's a 2 pay period month is approximately $2,700.00. Yearly gross is around $57,000.

My monthly expenses are $1,970.00. This includes a monthly car payment of $370. ($3,300 remaining) which will be paid off by August 2018 and a monthly school loan of $90 ($635 remaining) which will be paid off by June 2018. 

My credit card debit totals $20,700.00:
Card 1 (approx $,9,700 debt) - 10.90% APR with a minimum of $190.
Card 2 (approx $4,800 debt) - 25.9% APR with a minimum of $150.
Card 3 (approx $6,100 debt) - 21.99% APR with a minimum of $123.

Currently paying $96.00 a month for term and universal insurance. 

And paying $50.00 a month into a ROTH IRA, while also investing my rollover in a traditional IRA (approx $4,000). 

I have no money in savings and I've been attempting to pay the minimums on my cards every 2 weeks (doubling essentially), but often find myself having to resort to the cards again for simple necessities (gas/food) when it's towards the end of a pay period.

I like the avalanche approach to debt payment, would like your feedback on if that's best for this scenario? 

Also should I just focus on a small savings right now (one month of expenses) or should I create a larger savings? 

Any direction would be helpful. Finally, do any of you have any insider help on how to keep yourself focused to pay it off? I find I get driven and then 2 months later, I want to treat myself and I go on a binder and it's just bad news. 

Thank you!

How to invest (to buy a home)?,"I'm 22, live in Belgium and I've been working for a year now. I don't come from a lot of money, which means I've been building a life from 0.

Right now, I'm putting €100/month into a pension plan. That leaves me with, roughly, another €400 to invest or save.
One of my biggest concerns is being able to buy a house in the future. Which would be about €350.000.
I believe this means I need €35.000 to start a loan.

"Recently got kicked out of my home by my Aunt and Uncle, need some tips on what to do next.","To start things off, I recently turned 19(November 9th) and graduated high-school last may. My Aunt and Uncle received a 800-1000 dollar check from social-security for taking care of me: my mother died when I was two years old, so whoever had taken care of me received the check for me and my two other sisters until we graduated. My sisters had aged out of this check in 2008 and 2004, so I(my guardians, rather.) got the bulk of it until I graduated. 

This brings me to now: I had been working full-time to pay for my food, and a 100 dollar phone bill before I got kicked out in September(I should say that I wasn't 'kicked out', they just wanted 600 dollars in rent every month, 400 dollars if I went to college full time as well. I was also expected to have a car by the end of the month, so there was no realistic way to meet this expectation.)

Currently, I have 4 main bills, and I make about 800 a month: a 100 dollar phone bill(I got this plan when I was stable living with my aunt and uncle, but obviously things have changed since then and I need more money.), a 200 rent fee that I give to my sister and brother in law, 125 dollar insurance, and food. I have 200 dollars in the bank, but this is going to go towards licensing and titling a vehicle in the coming days: I'd like to have a pillow to fall back on by September when I start school, so any advice is appreciated! I'm currently reading everything on the sidebar, so I hope that will help as well. 

My situation is okay now, but it could be better, especially with financial security.

Looking to invest inheritance in $XAR and $ITA. Is this a bad idea?,"Hi PF and thank you in advance for any and all advice. 

I recently inherited about $20,000. 

I'm 25 y/o and completely debt free. I do not have a college degree and am not pursuing one currently. I dropped out after 2~ years and paid off all loans. I have a stable job with minor savings and am constantly putting away more. I don't have a high cost of living either. So for awhile now I've simply been practicing the art of frugality in order to increase my wealth. I have a serious S.O. but we are not tied very much financially. I do need to consider buying a house in a few years. However, that is not too dependent on this money or my current savings. 

I've been trying to increase my financial literacy bit by bit so forgive me if things come off skewed. 

I've learned a bit about mutual funds and ETFs and they appeal to me. I am of the idea that I want to essentially create a investment portfolio and forget about it for 5-10+ years. 

Because of this and also because of the modern age we live in, I think that aerospace and defense sector industries are optimal. Space is an untapped industry IMO and the defense industry will never go away until we're all dead. Lastly, when paired together, the two sectors are a match made in heaven. 

I've been looking at $XAR and $ITA ETFs. I believe ITA to be a strong long hold because of reasons stated above. They've never under performed at least. I don't know as much about XAR but I like the prospect of it because of holdings such as BWXT. I grew up around their HQ and know a bit about the scope of their influence and business. Looking at their recent performance, it seems they might be a good option. I kind of understand that it may be a bad idea to hold 2 ETFs in the same sector... but I would like that elaborated on a bit if that's the case. 

I also want to learn more about index funds. I don't have a clear idea of what to look for in them but everywhere I see is advertising Vanguard Index Funds.. so I think I want to see if it's feasible to put an investment into one of these in addition to ETFs.

Lastly, I've thought about a few single stocks to help diversify (here's a question and example of my ignorance, what to look for when diversifying??) as well. I don't even know if this is a good idea or not. The few that come to mind easily are Facebook, Google, and Disney. I wouldn't want to invest heavily in these, but rather place a smallish risk for the long hold. I foresee Facebook keeping it's King of the Hill status in social media. Same goes for Google and Disney in their respective specializations. Disney just acquired Fox and that's on top of owning Marvel, Lucas Arts, and Avatar IP. 

I am looking for mostly a confirmation that I'm somewhat along the right line of thinking. I don't know exactly understand what to watch out for with investing. I get, what I consider, the basics such as fees associated with trades. But not any of the more intangible risks associated with investing my money. This is the largest lump sum of money I'll have received at this point in life and so I think that has presented a lot of natural anxiety in any decision making I do.

Again, thank you for any advice. I'll try and answer any additional questions in a timely manner. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7kurec/looking_to_invest_inheritance_in_xar_and_ita_is/,1513704666,personalfinance
Graduating college early with no debt! Help me plan my future?,"Yeah, I have amazing wonderful parents who scrimped and saved so that this could happen. Plus, I had a big scholarship and worked by butt off to get out of there early to save my parents more. Because of this, my parents are going to continue to pay my rent and other expenses until June 1, 2018. I am one lucky duck. How do I make the most of the paid-for time until June, and what do I do after, to set myself on the best path?

I've applied to grad school for the fall. If I get in, it's fully-funded, and while I'll have to live frugally, I should be able to live off of just that funding for 3 years. I'll just need to finance the move to school and securing a place to live before I start to get paid.

If I don't get in (much more likely - I applied to difficult programs), I want to be able to afford to move to NYC. I know that's almost as expensive as it gets, but that's the goal.

My lease is up in August, which leaves me with 3 months of rent and expenses to pay for on my own until either grad school or hopefully-NYC.

Job situation: 
Paid internship in my field making $550/month
About to start additional part-time job in my field making about $1,200/month
Total monthly income: $1750/month

Bank account balance starting in January:
$3,200

Debts: nothing of any kind!

Expenses from January to June 1:
Only leisure/misc expenses, parents covering all else. I could definitely limit myself to a $600 budget for the 6 months and be more than fine. I could also splurge and spend $1,200 in the 6 months, but I would never spend more than that.

Expenses from June 1 to Aug 31:
Rent: $730/month
Utilities: usually $85/month
Transportation: $120/month
Total medical costs: $100/month (will still be on school insurance)
Gym membership: $45/month
Groceries: Here's one of my big questions. How much? Right now, with my parents reimbursing me, I spend about $200/month. That's with me not limiting myself in any way. I'm physically tiny and could eat just fine as low as $80/month, if I really planned and made some sacrifices.
Leisure/misc: could spend $100/month. Could also stop going out as much and really cut down here, maybe to $40/month?
(parents will be paying phone bill)
One time expense: In August, I'll need to buy another year of daily contact lenses. It's pricey but super worth it in my opinion. $300.

Total summer expenses, lowest and highest estimates: 
$3900 to $4440

I will be leaving both jobs at the end of August, having made something like $11,500 total after taxes. So, with my current bank balance, minus both the high and low ends of what I could spend between June and August, I will end August with around $10,000.

This is plenty to go to grad school with, but the idea of moving to NYC on this amount seems risky. Am I right on that? I would be splitting an apartment with a friend, and we've discussed trying to stick to a $1000-$1200/month budget for rent (yeah I know we're going to end up in an absolutely terrible apartment, but that's ok). I think I would get a job pretty quickly in New York, based on how easily I've gotten internships and work in college, and could do cashier type work if not. But is $10,000 enough to fall back on? (If something went horribly wrong, I would be able to move back in with my parents, which is another very lucky thing, I know.)

However, I might also be able to add to the $10,000 before I move out of my current city. I'm looking into some creative smaller income streams. Or maybe a weekend minimum wage job (although that might get exhausting and ultimately make me more stressed than it's worth, as I'm working 40 hours/week + 10 hours/week commuting, and have never done a full-time schedule before). 

So basically, my questions here: How much should I spend on food in the summer? On fun/misc stuff for the full 7 months? Is $10,000 an okay savings to move to NYC with, if I don't get into grad school, or should I be more aggressive in pursuing additional income? How much is ""enough"" for that move, with a roommate, but without a for-sure job waiting there? 

Should I look into investing? Should I start saving for retirement? Should I do a bit of both, and how much?

Should we cash in wife's 401k for home down payment,"Long time lurker



We moved cross country 10 months ago and quickly realized it was a mistake. We want to move back once jobs have been secured and would really like to buy rather than continue renting.

• HHI $130k (pre tax)

• Both have student loan debt ($85k total)

• Both carrying credit card debt ($25k total)

• Both with around $20k in car loan debt ($40k total)

• $2.2k/month rent currently

• Close to no savings (we lived well outside our means for the last 7 years)



The move we made and how we've behaved financially in our past has put us in a precarious situation.

75 year old dad had a stroke and is in nursing care. 55 year old mom will be up against a financial wall. What can we do?,"My dad was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in October. In November he had pneumonia, which led to heart failure, and then a stroke. Now he is in nursing care and is supposed to be there for 3 weeks, but it’s looking more doubtful that this will be a short term stay. Even if it is, it’s inevitable with the alzheimer’s that he will end up back here eventually. 

He is on Medicare and has some sort of coverage with Regence. My mom has been told that after 20 days in nursing care she will have a copay of $161 per day that he is there. That is more than she makes in a day, let alone her personal expenses. 

So the next option is Medicaid, which she wlll have to drain her assets to qualify for that. If he has life insurance, savings, anything, they will take it. His SS income will be theirs. They will take his care and whatever else they can. We aren’t quite sure where it stands on if they can take the house; sounds like it has to be valued at over 500k, and being in the Seattle area, that seems inevitable (if it’s not already there). 

Also my dad co-signed on my auto loan. He is also on my brother’s checking account. Will they take these assets, too?

What can my mom do to protect herself? She is too young to retire and must work if nothing else other than for the health benefits, but 55 is a difficult age to lose everything. (She makes ~38k/year pre tax). The house is on a half acre and can be split into another lot; should she sell the lot to get some money and also reduce the value of her home?

Buying and selling a house at the same time,"So there's a chance I could get a job across the state (4.5 hour drive away) in a few months. This job would be a great opportunity and I would absolutely take it if offered, and it would pay more than I am making now. That being said, I currently own a home with ~25% equity in it, and I would like to straight up buy a home when (if) I move there immediately. The problem - I don't have enough savings for another house down payment, I really only have about ~10k that's liquid right now.

What are my options? Could I take out a loan with little to no down payment and sell my house quickly, then put that money into the new house? My house is probably one of the easier to sell houses in my area, and I could probably sell it for a bit more than I paid for it. However, where I would be moving, the housing market is affordable-ish yet VERY competitive - many houses sell within a few days of being listed.

I would like to avoid renting if possible, for a couple of reasons. First, my company would pay for moving expenses, but only once - so moving from rent to house would be out of pocket. Second, I have so much stuff I wouldn't be able to fit it in an apartment (I would have to rent a storage unit or a house).

Replaced credit card but old card still works,"I gets texts for any charge over $10. I saw a $20 charge on 11/19 at an online pet store. That was not me. I got on the credit card web site to replace the card. The only problem was I had to report it as stolen. Done. 

That seems to work. I had a new card in five days. I tested the old card while waiting and was surprised to see it still worked. These were small charges for lunch. I actually though maybe they allow this so I'm not stranded while waiting for new card.

I activated the new card as soon as it arrived. It works too. I still test the old card occasionally expecting it to be rejected, but it continued to work. I contacted the company today to get this fixed.

The rep said it was strange and said it was serious and would open an investigation. Meanwhile he blocked the old card and had me call the fraud line to get the old card cancelled. I did that.

Later I tried to use my new card. It was rejected. The message said ""card blocked"". I contacted the company and again they say, that's strange.

I was directed to call a third department. It wasn't clear whether they can remove the block but they recommended leaving the block and getting a third card. I'll soon have to verify that two old cards have been deactivated.

I need some help with a payday loan.,"I'm not sure who else to go to about this.
I take care of my finances and credit, but my sister has gotten herself into a little hole. I'm helping her to rebuild her credit, but I want to first get her out from under this loan.

She took out a $500 loan around 8 months ago with Green Trust Cash, and I just found out she's been paying ~78 dollars a WEEK ever since.
I looked at the terms (she couldn't provide any info and I had to find her loan terms on my own) and she's paying 625% APR.

I emailed them asking for a payoff quote and they said it'd be around $425 and that ""this includes principal, interest, and any late or returned instrument charges if applicable"".

I know these are expensive loans and she's an idiot, but is this right? I mean if we pay it off now why are we paying (future) interest.

I guess I just need a little guidance if anyone had any advice. I'm more than likely going to pay this for her and I don't really have $400. I was expecting them to come back with around 100 since she's only got a couple more months on this thing.

If anyone knows what I can do, or if we're really locked in to this thing for the amount they quoted please let me know. I have zero experience with these places.

My apologies if this has been answered before, I couldn't find a whole lot about these loans using search.

Employer is slicing salary into salary/vacation/holiday pay. Is there any advantage or disadvantage?,"Just looked at my fiance's paystub and noticed this. Her salary is supposed to be 10k (in this example),

Do you have any idea why an employer would take some of the overall salary and put it in the ""vacation pay"" and ""holiday pay"" every pay period?  Say she makes 10k a year, but every pay period she has her salary (say $316), and then $50 each in holiday and vacation pay. The total of those 3 adds up to 10k through the entire year. 

Is this just a normal practice? I haven't even seen it in the jobs I worked and couldn't find much info. Seems a little shady as her salary should be her salary and vacation/holiday are just benefits.

Edit: to clarify this ironically has nothing to do with time off per pay period and shows the same numbers throughout the year

I’m having difficulty weighing the risks and benefits of two options.

Also, another question: If I opened a CD as a backup emergency fund vehicle to offset inflation, would I be able to deposit more funds at the same initial rate after the CD matures? (specifically, say I wanted to put 2k into a 2% Ally 1 year CD and when it expired the next year, would I be able to put 5k into the CD?)

Need to track costs basis of stocks purchased in the 80's.,"Some time in the 80's my father purchased stocks of the company he worked for through a direct investment plan.

He died in 2000. My mother did transfer ownership of the stocks to her within a year or two of his death (his entire estate passed to her). Long story short, some dividend checks from these checks were not properly claimed on her taxes and now the IRS says she owes them money. 

We were able to find out which stocks she currently owns (the split stocks have further split and now she has holdings in about 10 different companies). Bottom line, is we need to figure out the cost basis on these stocks first of all so that her taxes can be filed correctly and we have NO idea how to do that (we have neither certificates nor an exact date of purchase, he worked for this company from about 1979-1986).

"Minor accident, other driver doesn't want to go through insurance. What to do?","Hey /r/personalfinance! I could use your advice regarding a decision I need to make in the next few days. Apologies in advance for the wall of text. I reside in Massachusetts

A couple days ago, my elderly neighbor hit my parked leased 2016 Corolla with her 2015 Mercedes Benz. I immediately went outside to survey the damage. We took a look at both cars together, and I asked her for her insurance information. She refused. She stated that she would pay for the repairs, and that as she has lived next door for many years, she was not planning on going anywhere. She also became kind of confrontational, insinuating that I was in some way responsible because my car was not parked close enough to the adjacent wall to provide a clear path for her exit. (I've been parked there with my landlord's permission, for 2 years, and she has never previously approached me about this issue.) 

During the discussion, I took photos of her license plate, the damage on her car, and the damage on my car. Afterward, I also took photos of the driveway with a measuring tape to demonstrate the amount of space there was to pass my car (9ft 7 in., if you're curious).

I filed a report with my insurance, as I decided it would be the wise thing to do, as I am generally distrusting of verbal agreements especially when it comes to money. My insurance company stated that they were unable to locate her insurance information - I found her name and know her address, and that + plate didn't return anything in their search. Since I cannot contact her insurance company to file a claim, they said my only option is to go through my insurance company. I have not yet escalated this to claim status.

A few hours later, I visited a body shop I trust (they've done great work for me before), and procured a detailed estimate for repairing the damage. I rang my neighbor's doorbell this morning to share this information and she didn't answer. I called her phone number and she answered. She asked me how much the estimate was for ($1,200) I told her, and she said it was too expensive and that they were wrong. She asked why I did not go to the body shop she suggested, and I responded that she doesn't get to choose where I get my car repaired. She then accused me of being unneighborly, that she was a nice old lady and that I was trying to prey on her, etc. I asked again for her insurance information and she hung up on me.

I then took the car to the body shop she suggested and asked the person working there to call her with the estimate ($326 less than the first option, though totally verbal and not itemized). The owner called her and seemingly also argued with her about the cost. It seemed (although I could not hear her end of the conversation) that she agreed to pay the amount. In the end, he said I could bring the car to him on Monday, he would fix it and charge her for the repairs. 

Now I am struggling with what to do. I am leaning heavily toward filing a claim through my insurer and using the body shop I trust and letting them handle retrieving payment; however, the challenge is that I'm getting some pressure from a parent (who is of similar age as the other party in this situation) to visit the second body shop and let them handle it. I am afraid that situation could end my paying for repairs out of pocket if she decides not to pay. I am also nervous about the quality of work that will be done on the car, as it seems to be a very cash-centric operation. I'm also worried that the neighbor may be driving without insurance. On the other hand, this person lives right next door to me, and so that relationship (not that there really was one before) could be strained if she expresses dislike of my tenancy to my landlord (who thinks I'm a great tenant) or ends up facing significant legal or financial consequences if there is something more insidious (uninsured motorist or unfit to drive) going on.

tl;dr: Neighbor hit my parked car and is insistent that I get repairs (for which she has presumably agreed to pay) at a specific auto body shop and will not share insurance information.

What do you think /r/personalfinance? Is filing a claim through my insurance the right thing to do, or should I go the out-of-pocket + verbal agreement route?

Update 12/3: Thank you all so much for the advice! I called my insurance company again today and the rep with whom I spoke tried running her plates again with different search parameters and was able to locate her insurance information. I went ahead and filed the claim (my insurance company waived the deductible), and will be taking the car in for repairs in the coming days.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7h6pb3/minor_accident_other_driver_doesnt_want_to_go/,1512263515,personalfinance

Total noob: opened a Vanguard broker account... want to purchase ETFs.,"Hi folks!

I have $60,000 sitting in a savings account at my credit union. I want to invest half of this in ETFs.

I opened a Vanguard brokerage account today, and they sent me an e-mail saying it will take a few days to confirm everything. To start off, I pulled about $4,000 from my savings account into the Vanguard account. This hasn't been debited from my savings account yet, but I do see it immediately on Vanguard.

Now I want to get started with purchasing ETFs. I see the option to purchase ETFs and other ""instruments"" such as stocks. I also see the page where I can see all the Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs listed (on different tabs). Clicking into an ETF, I can see information on risk, progression over the past year, buy link, etc.

Here are some specific questions:

* I am assuming I just wait for the next confirmation e-mail from Vanguard, and then I should proceed with picking the ETFs I want?
* Is there a minimum amount I need to contribute into each ETF or does that depend on the ETF?
* Every time I have cash to invest, I just pull it into my Vanguard account and can just purchase additional ETFs (or whatever instrument I want)?
 * Assume I want to invest $2,000 every month into specific stocks, mutual funds or etf's... I would just pull that money into my account and then pick what I want to purchase? Is that all? Do I need to immediately report anything to the IRS?

I looked through the side bar and while it gave me tons of useful ""high-level"" information, I wasn't able to get these specific questions answered.

Appreciate your time folks.

"Currently Financing Lexus, Want to Lower Monthly Car Payment - HELP!","Hi all,

I am currently paying out the butt for a dream car (2015 Lexus RC350 F Sport AWD). 

$800/month, a little over 2 years out of the 5 year loan term.  I'd like to lower my monthly car payment. 

I started a new job and my commute has been reduced to a mere .6 miles round trip per day, opening up options to lease. I also moved to a new state, so I need to do my car registration ASAP, which is a pain the butt and costs money for inspection and for the rest of the DMV processes.

Note: My car is worth about $29k, and I have $27.6k left on the loan.

I see my options are: 

1.  Refinance my loan (has a $150 fee and will incur more interest over the term of the loan, and probably a higher interest rate. Currently have a 1.74% rate). It is a nice car with all the options I would like and with AWD. Add costs for switching states and such.
2.  Get a new car - lease. I've never done a lease as I used to drive ~20k miles a year from work. This would easily lower my payment, and i do not have to deal with anything related to the car's registration. I would most likely still lease a luxury car as the options are much nicer and AWD sedans are limited selection elsewhere.
3. Get a new car - finance. This option probably drops be into standard car selections and will have less options and maybe no AWD (we get snow in my area). 
4. Suck it up, I can afford it. Just less money into savings.

If I convert to Roth, will the tax payment come out of the 401k funds or will I need to save enough money for the taxes first?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7h55u4/thinking_of_converting_401k_to_roth/,1512247633,personalfinance

How do I choose a credit card among the ocean of credit cards?,"I'm 28 and I've never owned a credit card in my life, both to my benefit and my peril, probably.

I live a simple life and I figured I'd probably just use a credit card for necessities, i.e. gas and groceries, chiefly to improve my credit score. I don't know if I'd need one tailored to my lifestyle, though I enjoy photography and the outdoors and travel, if that helps, though I've heard travel-based cards aren't that worth it. I rarely stay in hotels.

I was actually particularly inspired to get a credit card after reading a redditor's post on the importance of them in this sub. 

I suppose I don't entirely understand everything - the points system, the nomenclature surrounding it, how interest applies, etc. (For example, why would I pay a fee every year to use a credit card? And why would I pay interest on one when I can just avoid interest altogether with a debit card?)

I keep asking for advice from friends and family and I receive inconsistent advice each time. I've been suggested a Discover card, an Amex gold premier rewards card, and a Citi double rewards card with cash back and no annual fees. But I still don't know if any of those are ""the right one,"" and I've been doing research (Creditcards.com, thepointsguy.com) to ascertain more information, but I just end up totally ambivalent and then don't make a choice.

What I can say is that I'd be extremely responsible with my card. I'm not a frivolous spender; I'm quite frugal and careful with my money after watching my parents destroy their lives with asinine financial decisions. I'd be using my card solely for necessities that I'd be buying anyway, and promptly pay the bill each month.

Can any /personalfinance friends help a thoroughly confused redditor out? Thanks a bunch!

"Eligible to open an HSA, looking for advice on where to open one","I just purchased my first health plan on healthcare.gov as opposed to my employer's plan because their HDHP's premium was 13% of my gross income which I found outrageous and unaffordable. The plan I picked is an HMO high deductible plan that is eligible for an HSA. I've been reading up on how they work and so far understand that they are a savings account for health related expenses, there is a maximum amount you can contribute per year, some accounts allow you to invest, and you are not taxed when adding, investing, or withdrawing funds.

I make about $20,000 per year and am planning on adding approximately $100 per month to my HSA. I am not planning on investing any of it, but will probably let the money sit and will use it to reimburse myself for any doctor bills I incur. I like the suggestion I've seen on here to pay your bills with a cash back credit card, keep the receipts, and reimburse yourself at a later time. So, I'm wondering what banks I should consider opening an account with that have the least amount of fees since I will not have a very high balance and am not planning on investing any of it. Also, since I purchased this plan on my own and not through my employer, am I still able to contribute portions of my paychecks pre-tax, or can I only deposit money afterwards?

rIRA / 401k / General investment distribution,"Looking for advice on investment distribution / diversification.

Current situation:
0 debt

Maxing 401k

Maxing Roth IRA (first year payed in)

Have an emergency fund

Have additional money I'm investing normally

25 y/o

So I've read a lot about balanced portfolios (three fund portfolios mainly) and distribution between US / International / Bonds and wanted to sound some things out.

401k:
Currently completely hands off and in a target return fund which to my understanding is handling its own diversification and risk based on distance from retirement date etc... I don't touch this at all and consider this the safe / appropriate distribution.

Roth IRA:
Again first year paying in so it's only really $5500. As stated I read a bit about three fund portfolios e.g. VTI / VXUS / BND and choosing distribution based on risk. Since I'm relatively young I have a high risk tolerance and am wondering if including bonds in my distribution makes sense at all at this point. Even 40 / 40 / 20 or 50 / 30 / 20 (US / Int / Bonds) is only $1100 into bonds. Since I consider the 401k to be doing most of my real retirement distribution with the Roth (at least with it at only 5500) to be the aggressive one does it make sense to go 100% ETF (stock biased) this early and adjust later if I can keep contributing?

General Investing:
So in addition to the above I've got non-retirement investment money currently mostly in VOO. I have no short term intentions / goals for this money other than to grow it (not saying it needs to be short term growth just that it doesn't depreciate and ideally increases over time). Is there a point with retirement investment covered by ETFs / target funds that putting general investment funds into specific blue chip stocks makes sense over funds if you have no real risk expectations over that money? (Think VISA, MSFT, etc...)

From what I've read it seems like just sticking with ETFs (or fund equivalents of) like VOO / VTI are ideal risk / reward wise long term, I just wasn't sure if it makes sense to be mirroring portfolios across both the Roth IRA and general investments (Somewhat tripling as target fund likely has some of the same underlying holdings).

"Is it a good idea for me to study abroad ( and spend TONS of money, but possibly improve my quality of education) or stay in my ( third-world) country.","Greetings everyone. An opportunity opened up for me to study abroad, specifically in New Zealand, and I'm willing to take it. Problem is, however, I'd need about $19k ( roughly 1,000,000 in my currency) to fully situate myself. This already accounts for 3 Years of Tuition Fee, Living Expenses, and Preparation Fees. I'm not really gifted on Academics so a Scholarship is out of the question. A certain organization is helping me on the process, so I only need to present them the money and they'll get me on my way.

My family is poor, my parents earning about $70 per month, and that's barely enough for food and transportation. I'm very willing to change it however, now that I'm turning 18 this year and I can finally work. I swore to myself that I'll literally work myself to death to get what I want. But I'm torn between studying abroad (which costs PHP 1,000,000 for 3 Years) or studying here ( the best schools in the Philippines would cost me about PHP 800,000 for 3 Years). I'm currently in Senior High and am planning to go abroad for college, so that means I have 1 Year to earn PHP 1,000,000 to be able to study abroad. If I can land on a low-paying job I can earn PHP 15,000 per month, and that doesn't even account for my living expenses. 

The advantage of studying here is I can pay off my tuition as I study, and it's cheaper. 

Studying abroad, however, means I'll have a better quality of education, I can earn more considering I'll get a job, and I only have to worry about my living expenses since the 1 Mil is for 3 Years.

Employer Expense Reimbursement-Is This Normal?,"I didn't see anything related to this in the wiki, my apologies if I missed something!

My SO routinely expenses a number of things for his work. Mainly travel expenses or meals for clients/employees. 
He pays for this directly with his credit card, and is reimbursed at the end of the month by payroll.

Normally, the reimbursement happens within 30 days of the expenses (although there have been rare instances where the reimbursement is delayed due to payroll issues), however, the company also has a policy which does not allow reimbursement until after the event being expensed has occurred. For example, when he buys a plane ticket, the reimbursement will not occur until the period after the flight takes place. 

I have some concerns about my SO taking on some of these financial burdens on behalf of his employer, but assuming we are reimbursed in a timely manner, the credit card points are definitely a benefit for us, so that seems to balance the risk. However, I have much larger concerns about the instances where we end up waiting for months to be reimbursed for flights. Of course it makes more sense for the company to want to purchase plane tickets in advance when a better price is available. And so far, we have been fortunate and vigilant enough to have the ability to pay off our credit cards each month. Usually though, we have to pull from our savings to accomplish this when we're in limbo waiting for reimbursement. This leaves a sour taste in my mouth - I am very risk averse myself, and I am not sure I find it appropriate for our personal finances to be impacted to such an extent by my SO's employer. We do not own property yet and our personal expenses are low, but if that ever changes but I think it could put us in a more challenging financial position.  

I am wondering if it is standard to have such a policy regarding employee expenses - specifically one that limits reimbursement until after the event being reimbursed occurs. I am unfamiliar with this type of policy, and I'm hoping to get a better understanding before I advocate for any specific type of action. My initial thoughts are that we should maybe push harder to wait to take on these costs until the month of the event, but I wonder whether it is worth the fight if this is something that is an industry norm? Should we just eat the risk and restructure our budget to allow for these expenses?

If anyone has any insight, I would really appreciate it! 

The SO's company is a small business - maybe less than 50 employees - if that makes a difference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7laapt/employer_expense_reimbursementis_this_normal/,1513871686,personalfinance
My side business expenses for 2017 might exceed the total revenue. How will that impact my taxes when I file next year?,"I won't know until I get all my income statements and file but my expenses this past year have been really high, so much so that it's possible my revenue from my side gig will be less than what I spent on it. This isn't anything terrible as it's just less things I'll have to pay for later such as business cards, and I have a full-time salaried job that pays the real bills. However, I'm curious how that will impact my return. 

I understand that you are only taxed on your profit, meaning your revenue minus your expenses. I read somewhere that if your expenses exceed revenue it will not increase your return since you can't be taxed on negative income (meaning you won't be paid), but the extra losses will carry over into the following year. Is this accurate?

"Recently changed jobs. Should I roll over my previous 401k into my new one, or keep them separate for diversification?","I recently changed jobs. At my previous job, I contributed into a Fidelity 401k plan. My new job has a 401k plan through a different provider. 

Since I can no longer contribute to the Fidelity 401k, it seems my choices are limited to:

- rolling over the Fidelity into the new plan, or
-  keeping the Fidelity 401k separate, to diversify my portfolio a bit.

Not really sure what would be the better long-term approach. I like the idea of diversification, but also not sure if the fidelity account will get eaten into from maintenance fees etc., and since I can no longer contribute to it, it's rate of growth is limited.

On the other hand, I might see better growth throwing it all into my new employer's 401k, but it's a less-well-known plan and I'm uncertain about its long-term growth compared to the Fidelity account.

Using capital gains to qualify for healthcare premium credits? Can I get reimbursed?,"Hi. I didn't work this past year because I'm a full time student. I’m also a veteran using my GI Bill so that covers my basic living needs. This year I paid over 200$ a month in health insurance because I didn't make over ~12000$ this year in taxable income(which would qualify me for the credit), and I don't qualify for Medicaid. Earlier this year I invested in some cryptocurrency that’s done well for me. If I sold some cryptocurrency assets for ~12000$ in capital gains, would that then be considered 12000$ in income for this year? If so, from my understanding I would qualify for the healthcare premium credit. Would I get reimbursed for all the previous payments I made this year? 
 
Or would it be more beneficial to sell some of these assets in 2018 in order to qualify for premium tax credit help?

Dissenting shareholder and taxes,"I'm part of a dissenting shareholder group in a Chinese ADR company (was listed on the NASDAQ) that went private in late 2016.  The court proceedings are still ongoing and the outcome will be determined in early 2018.

However, in 2017, everyone in the group was paid an ""interim payment"" via wire which essentially means the amount we were owed based on the buyout offer made in 2016 (i.e. buyout price per share * number of shares held).

The wrinkle is that in 2016 when the buyout went through, no proceeds were ever deposited into my brokerage account.  In other words, when I filed my 2016 taxes earlier this year, I didn't claim a $3,000 max loss because this loss never showed up on my 1099 (because the shares were never technically ""sold"").  Through the court proceedings this year, it was decided that the dissenting shareholders in our group should be given their investment proceeds (""interim payment"") and, meanwhile, the fair value proceedings are still ongoing.  I received this interim payment in June 2017.

Although I currently am down on this investment (buyout price was significantly lower than my purchase price), I'm fairly confident that when the court proceedings are settled, I will come out ahead.

My question is this -- how does this all work for tax purposes?  Should I have claimed a loss in 2016?  Do I have to pay taxes on the gains if the court proceedings go in my favor in 2018?

I'll definitely reach out to a CPA at some point early next year, but just wanted to get an idea of what I should be expecting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7h4c6b/dissenting_shareholder_and_taxes/,1512239699,personalfinance

"24, Debt free, getting married soon, looking for critiques on my short and long term goals/assessment of my financial health! Thanks!","Hey reddit, looking for some help with planning. Sorry for the long post, but I want to be thorough so you guys have what you need to help me. I am 24, and in the Marine Corps. I have several goals for the next few years, and am not sure I’m going about them the right way. My monthly income is 4,350 after taxes and a 10% contribution to my TSP (a Roth IRA). Annual is 52,200. My monthly bills come out to about 1,145, but I would say I spend an extra 900 or so on gas, food, entertainment, and other expenses. I’m putting away about 2,000 a month into my savings account right now. I currently have 12,500 in my savings account, and 7,000 in my TSP. I began contributing to my TSP in June of 2016. I am completely debt free as of this summer, two years out of college. I should be getting a pay raise in July of 2018 by several hundred dollars a month. I should be getting promoted sometime in between July of 2019 and July of 2020, which would be a really significant pay boost.


My goals for 2018 are to have 10,000 for an engagement ring (which is already in my account), to have 10,000 to put down on a brand new 4Runner (aka a Slick Rick Mobile), and to have 10,000 set aside for the wedding (which will likely take place in the fall of 2019).


My goals for 2019 are to have 25,000 set aside for the wedding, meaning saving an additional 15,000 in 2019, and to maintain a 1,000 dollar a month payment for the car that I plan on buying at the end of 2018.


Thinking more long term, I plan on buying a house within a few years. If I get stationed in California next (I could be going out there as soon as September of 2018), the houses are extraordinarily expensive (about 500,000 for a 1500 sq ft, 3 bed 2 bath). I want to put the house on a 15 year note. My girlfriend is also military, so if we’re living out there, we would both be pulling in a Basic Allowance for Housing. That would total over 6,000 a month. Rent would likely be around 1,500 to 2,500 a month anyways, so I don’t think a mortgage would be that much more expensive. We would put the remainder of the 6,000 towards the principal if we did buy, and if we rent, we would save that for a down payment somewhere else. With the VA loan, we would not need anything down to purchase. Not even sure if buying out there makes sense given (my estimate) of the current market.


So question time: 

- Is my 10% contribution to my TSP enough for retirement? I plan on doing 20 years and getting a pension, but obviously things could change, and I’m concerned that only 10% isn’t going to be enough. My girlfriend probably won’t stay in for 20, but she is contributing to her TSP (10% as well) and if she gets out, she is looking at going to dental school.

- If my TSP is not enough, what else should I look into? A traditional IRA? Stocks? Blood Diamonds? - I’m aware that I’m having an awful lot of cash sitting around in a savings account that isn’t making me any money, but I’m planning on spending it soon (within a year of me getting it). It is okay to let it sit there right?

- Am I going about accomplishing all these things the right way? Really, if you’ve got any suggestions for me, please feel free.

Thanks in advance, I’ve seen you guys help other people out with some really great advice, so I hope you can do the same for me!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7natoz/24_debt_free_getting_married_soon_looking_for/,1514752519,personalfinance

The situation:

My fiancée is in grad school in California for her MBA and has about $60,000.00 left to pay. She has $50,000.00 worth of Intel stock that if sold would be taxed as a long term gain. 

If sold, 15% ($7,500.00) would be taken for fed tax. I am unsure what would be taken for state tax. She makes $93,000.00 a year currently. 

The question I have is what would be the better choice to make. Sell, pay tuition and claim tax credit or hold and hopefully continue to collect gains from the stock assuming the market doesn’t turn downward?

I understand that this information may not be known by you all good people in PF, but I though I'd ask and see if there are some regulations for retirement benefits in the US that let employees have some leniency as to what accounts they want to use.

The reason I am asking aside from that is so I know ahead of time and open the respective retirement accounts that I want to use.

I have about $100 dollars to my name right now. I don’t have any debt besides $1,000 dollars on my credit card which I will pay off in two weeks. 

I work full time but the pay is rather low at $12 an hour. I have taken a few years off school to receive my bachelors and I plan to get back into classes in a few months. With a death in the family, it set me back in college as I was skipping class and missing assignments due to my past depression. Only reason I say this is because my gpa is too low to receive any FASFA loans until my grades are above a 2.0. My only option is a private loan through my bank and I know the interest is substantially high. I have about two years left at the most. 

I’m curious as to how to move forward. Is there a reasonable way to save money as well as knock down my debt with a private loan as quickly as possible?

Rent: $360
Utilities: $150
Food and gas: Around $300

My friends are saying it's better to keep the car because I'll be done with the payments in a few years, but I don't see the value of owning a car anyway. I hate driving. There were days where I chose to just drink water because I don't want to drive and forgot to buy food.

My SSN is compromised and am looking for help.,"Hello everyone and thank you for reading! Sorry if this doesn't belong here, I did read the PF rules and hope I am not breaking any.

Unfortunately a few days ago I was hit by identity theft. The thieves managed to contact my phone provider and disable my Wifes and my SIM cards. Shortly after they accessed my online bank account, changed my password, and did a direct transfer of $2500. I was sitting at my computer at my time so I was able to regain control of my Bank account. Shortly after that they were also able to access my Wives online account and attempted a transfer there as well. I was able to disable all cards immediately. We were able to get some friends to come over and lend us their phone to get our bank accounts frozen.

Now we are at the recovery stage. We have an appointment with the bank today to get new cards, have our accounts unfrozen and to see if there are any security steps we can take on our accounts to negate the chances of this happening again. 

I am now looking for advice on what to do next. I created a social security account and have that setup. I was planning to call the IRS to report the identity theft but to be honest I just do not know where to go next.

"As a non-american, can someone take a look at this budgeting for an non-american student in USA and correct me where I am wrong?","Hi. As an non-american, I did some math as to what the expenses/savings will be for an non-american student/immigrant in America who just got his first job of $100k but with a student loan of $50k. I do not have any plans to study in USA but I am curious about the math because I feel an immigrant will probably not save much. Please go through the list below and correct me where I am wrong. I have calculated it for one year basis and not monthly.

Total salary: $100,000/year

Taxes: $33,000/yr (Federal + State + FICA)

Rent: $24,000/yr (I believe it's anywhere between $1500-$3500 for a 1BHK in major cities + good location?)

Student Loan Payment: $12,000/yr (6% on $50k for 5 year term)

Groceries: $4500/yr (at $350/month x 12)

Health Insurance: $3600/yr (I see the common health plans are between $250-$350 premium per month for a single individual)

Dental insurance: $500/yr

Home utilities: $3500/yr (Electricity: $100/month + Water and sewage: $100/month + Internet: $50-$70/month +Garbage,Laundry and other minor utilities: $25/month)

Travel expenses to &amp; fro from work: $1200/yr (With a $100 bus pass a month)

Foreign travel plane tickets: $ 1200 (Usually immigrants go back to visit their homeland once a year or two)

Weekend fun: $1500/yr (bars + booze + uber or other travel once a week or so)

Other minor expenses: $500/yr


I havent included the following: House deposit money paid to landlord, any visa charges, paid services like netflix, prime, spotify, any entertainment stuff, emergency fund, money sent to 401k fund, a car, any major splurge, any deductible health problem charges, gym, hobbies, clothes, electronic gadget purchases or dating/relationship expenses or the losses occured while you were pursuing your Masters degree like the plane ticket expenses or the salary you may have earned for those 2 years in your home country.

And despite that the expenses seem to go out to $85k per year. Leaving about $15,000 in yearly saving or just a little over $1,250 in saving per month. I feel, a net saving of $15,000/yr on the prized ""$100k job salary"" seems very poor. But from what I've read a lot of students here would kill for a $1,250 saving per month because they save even less. Because this is a good case scenario with nothing going wrong. The savings are at par at what one would net in a third world tech job with a few years of experience. 

I would appreciate if some of you guys could take a look at my above math and correct me as to where I've missed or overshot the $$. I wouldn't mind some tidbits from your personal finances and how they relate to the above as well.

Thank you.

Also first post on PF. Be nice :)

I tell the guy that there must be some sort of mistake and a few minutes later he comes back with a report from Equifax saying that they do cannot locate my information and that what I provided was a potential scam.

A few years ago, I had a legal name change but I made sure that my bank and all companies with which I have a line of credit updated their records, so I'm not sure if that's the problem.

What do I do?


Edit: Just got off the phone with Equifax. Turns out, not only did they have my previous name on file but an address I have not live in for 5 years. They told me to open a dispute, can't do it online cause their entire system sucks, so I'll be mailing them a letter with my documents.

I am in a situation now where I find myself thinking about money and my future almost 24/7 to the point of being diagnosed with anxiety a few months ago and more recently MDD. I was told by a friend that this subreddit helps people with solving money problems and so here I am giving it a try.

My question is what exactly can I do to build my current savings account, I have no car, very few personal belongings worth selling and no job or jobs (I live in a small area with little growth). Also I have no method of acquiring money besides holiday cash from family and the occasional penny found in the parking lot. 
Are there any ways for me to invest at this age or make some kind of money besides what I am doing (selling literally everything I can) or am I out of luck until I hit the curb at 18.

Family member is battling heart disease and has no health insurance or stable income. What are my options?,"I'd prefer to keep things generic to provide some level of anonymity, but one of my parents who is more or less estranged from my immediate family as well as several portions of our extended family is basically at the brink of death after experiencing what amounts to heart failure.

While I haven't been in deep contact with them due to aforementioned issues, I was recently informed by my only other sibling that their condition has gotten progressively worse and worse after they had a stroke a few years back. To make matters more complicated, this parent is currently living with my sibling as they are essentially homeless (staying at friends places, not on the street) due to lack of a stable income.

Based upon the conversation with my sibling, this parent is basically on the verge of death and now my sibling and I are trying to figure out next steps since the parent has more or less alienated everyone in his life from a financial standpoint.

This is here my sibling and I come into play. We're both in our mid 20s with an average amount of debt between us (around 25k in student loan debt) woth decent jobs, but we need help in figuring out what to do with this parental figure.

They've essentially ruined the rest of our families financial wellbeing at one point or another with their actions and we have no intent to get into any more debt because of them. 

Based upon my siblings statement, it seems like they honestly won't make it longer than a month or two without a full on heart transplant - which neither of us could or want to pay for. We're pretty much down to the options of 

1) Waiting until they die and paying for the coroner's and cremation fees. No funeral service or anything else 

2) Trying to get them charity care in a hospital. This doesn't seem possible as it looks like they need prior taxes records. Knowing the parent in questions financial history, I doubt they have access go these records or hell, even paid them for the past few years.

I'm in contact with this parent's siblings to see of they can provide some guidance, but I'm not at trying to get them to help with the financial burden. We literally just have no experience in this area and every body that would normally help out in this case has been so badly alienated that I doubt they will.

Additional concerns are related to other financial debt they had carried. I worked with my other parent to make sure this parent never had taken loans out in my name, but what are the repercussions there? I know that as long as I wasn't a cosigner, debt doesn't get transferred on. However, with this parent lacking an estate or any formal assets, what happens to their debt? Does it just get it written off or will they get transferred to my sibling and I?

Please, any help I can get would be appreciated.

Is switching to PAYE worth it after 5 years of IBR? (x-post r/studentloans),"Do the benefits of 5 less years and only 10% discretionary income payment on PAYE outweigh 5 years' worth of interest capitalizing on IBR?

Would the 3 years interest-free period restart again if I've already been on IBR?

Does the 1 month standard payment in between plans still apply or could I get deferment/forbearance for that month?

Ultimately applying for PSLF (which I know this all wouldn't technically matter) but I don't trust Dumpster Fire and his cronies not to get rid of the program and I'm nervous I'd be extra screwed if when they did gut it. Never considered PAYE because I didn't realize I'd be eligible with the Direct Consolidation Loan. I would be consolidating 3 extra direct loans at a higher interest rate (on top of all the ones I have to consolidate for PSLF eligibility) to be able to sign up for PAYE since they were all disbursed before 10/12.

Am I in good financial standing to divorce?,"I’m contemplating divorce after a very short marriage in California. Looking to get all of my ducks in a row before making any rash decisions. Wanted to get top-level advice about my financial readiness and what some logical steps would look like.

No joint bank accounts 
No kids


Myself:
I make 50k/year
$10,000 in savings 
Own my car 
No debt
401k account w/ $8,000


Him:
He makes $130k+/ year
$50,000+ in savings

Using Cash app for saving?,"Hi pf! My best friend and I are going on vacation next summer and have started saving in advance. We both use Cash to send money to and from one another on a regular basis and had the idea of making another Cash account to hold our vacation funds. I made it with an email I created specifically for the account, and my friend is able to log in anytime by entering the email and then the authorization code sent to the email.

We both have savings accounts but we would both rather keep our vacation savings separate from our regular savings. We also would prefer not to just have the money sitting in our checking accounts. We thought about doing old fashioned envelopes stuffed with cash, but we need the money to be accessible to both of us (we live in different states) and we need it to be available to use online for booking the hotel.

Should I do an income-driven repayment plan for my 30k student loans?,"I had planned to do an income driven repayment plan because I am currently saving for my wedding that is next September. I thought there would be no downsides to doing this, but I recently saw a post on here about how bad those payment plans are so I’m worried. 
More about my situation: I make $45,000/year, have 30k in student loans and will be paying 100% of my ~$7,000 wedding (fiancé is still in school so can only minimally contribute). My plan had been to only be on this income based plan until I get married, at which point I was planning on putting 100% of my income towards my loan and completely living off of my husband’s salary. Another thing to note, I looked into it and it says my monthly payments would be $0 because it’s based off my income from last year, at which time I was a student and made like $8000 the entire year. I can definitely afford to pay more than $0/month, and would like to. I just can’t afford the $250-$300 payment I’d have if I didn’t do an income based plan. 

My questions about income based repayment plans are: 
•are they a terrible idea? If so, why?
•can I get off of it at any time?
•can I make more than my minimum payment when on this plan?

Recently this has changed as I have found full time employment, I’ve taken steps to pay off the credit card and catch up on my student loan payments. I only have about $100 left on the credit card but my student loan payment will take me another 8-12 months to catch back up on my payments (I’ll continue paying monthly after that until it’s paid off)

Advice on managing money for college.,"So, I start the long road towards getting my engineering degree in a couple weeks, and after running the numbers, I'm going to need around 12 grand ( that's including tuition, cost of living, everything), to make it through to summer. 

The problem is, I'll only be able to make 4 grand working during that time, and I'm inelegible for most loans and grants because of how much my parents make, and the low tuition of my first semester. Unfortunately my plan for saving went out the window, as I wound up with some respitory problems, and couldn't work for the last couple months.

I do have the offer of an intrest free 20 grand loan from my grandmother, but I would like to use as little of that as possible. (It'll look a lot better when tuition alone is 12k per semester).

So, my question is, what are some creative ways to cut costs and make money? I'm already selling my car and most other valuble things I own, but it's only going to bump me up about $2,000, and cut costs by $200/mo. I live on a small remote island, so commuting will be $500/mo, nothing I can do there.

So of course my vehicle was totalled in an accident that was not my fault, but the other driver did not have insurance so everything went through my own provider. Got everything straightened out, all contracts cancelled, and created a gap claim. Gap paid a little over $271 to the lienholder, and now there is a balance of about $155, for which I am ""delinquent."" 

I called the gap company to get an explanation and they basically told me the reason there is a balance is because they need to subtract the condition adjustment of the vehicle determined by the insurance company. This doesn't make ANY sense to me because the amount the insurance company paid for the vehicle already included a condition adjustment. I talked to the supervisor and explained to her that this doesn't make sense, and that they are essentially charging me double for the condition of my vehicle. She simply said it is all stated in the contract and that's what I signed. So I asked for a copy of the contract, but have yet to receive it.

Here is the gap claim: https://imgur.com/a/lBvpg

What I need help with is kind of twofold: first, am I crazy for thinking this situation is really strange and that my gap insurance should pay the remaining balance? Although I don't have a copy of the contract I signed, here is the brochure that advertises the gap insurance: https://imgur.com/a/4DL0b

The second thing I'm wondering is, if I'm really shit out of luck, would my credit take a severe hit if I simply don't pay this balance? My credit score is very good (713), I've had literally no derogatory marks in my entire history. My lienholder already sent me a letter I received today that says they've reported the account to the bureaus as ""unpaid balance reported as a loss by credit grantor.""

Thanks for any help you can offer.

"Need a reliable car with a couple months, but don’t want to borrow money to get it. Advice?","Recently, my truck got stolen and gutted (Fuck you, Atlanta). Now, I’m looking at a new (to me) vehicle. 

I, personally, would prefer to pay cash and be done with it because I don’t want to borrow money (already having debt related to school), but my parents are concerned that anything in my price range ($4-6k) isn’t reliable enough for me drive out to CA when my job moves me out there early next year. They are also against me paying cash and draining my savings account on an old, high mileage vehicle that could, very soon after purchase, need a major repair or leave me stranded out in Bumfuck on my way out to CA. 

Based on the criteria my parents would like to see in a vehicle I buy, I’d be spending $12-15k (putting about $3-4K down and financing the rest). 

What are some of your opinions on how I should handle this situation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7its8q/need_a_reliable_car_with_a_couple_months_but_dont/,1512910870,personalfinance
Which loan should I pay off next?,"Hi guys,

I have a few student loans out there and have a bit of excess cash (approx. $5k) to throw at them and was wondering which one to pay off next and if my overall repayment plan makes sense.

As it stands I have 6 loans out there that are either private or public (govt).

* Loan 1 - private - $41,827 at 8.5% interest
* Loan 2 - govt - $3,571 at 5%
* Loan 3 - govt - $3,180 at 6.8%
* Loan 4 - govt - $3,613 at 6.8%
* Loan 5 - govt - $4,832 at 5.6%
* Loan 6 - govt - $4,690 at 4.5%

For a bit of context I do have a plan to pay off the private loan in one lump sum in a few years. The company I work for has a sharing scheme where the next time they're sold to an investment company I will get a bonus equal to 75% my last 12 months salary. This is scheduled to happen in 2021 so factoring in only raises on my current salary I'm guessing the amount will be about 41k.

Otherwise I'm going to chip away with one large amount annually in addition to my monthly payments.

So, with about $5,000 to contribute now what should I put it towards?

Apologies if this is inarticulate or lacking in detail. Please let me know what other information I can provide as any advice is greatly appreciated. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/7i3lqz/which_loan_should_i_pay_off_next/,1512617038,personalfinance
how to get decent health insurance when you're part of the working poor?,"one of my friends is in a really horrible financial situation and might lose healthcare and i was wondering if anyone had any advice.

they're in chicago age 23 if that's relevant.

&gt;Well, currently earn about $1500/month.
&gt;Registered on healthcare.gov.
&gt;And even with my tax credit, the cheapest monthly premium on a plan that includes my psychiatrist and therapist would be $200/month.
&gt;In addition to any co-pays and such.
&gt;Or I could pay less, but have only one or none of my doctors covered, and an obscenely high deductible.

&gt;I currently don't have insurance at all, and when I get sick.. well.... I just hope for the best, I guess.
&gt;But I really need counseling and primary care.
&gt;Vision would be nice, since my contacts are over $300/year, but I'm being realistic.
&gt;So I don't know what to do.
&gt;Because the window to get care closes in 4 days.
&gt;But also even if I get a plan, I'm not sure I'll be able to pay anyway, neither the high premium or the high out-of-pocket costs from a high deductible.
&gt;So what do.

&gt;Also, yes I did declare [person living with them] as a dependent.
&gt;Apparently the premium should still be $13% of my monthly income, when rent is already over 60%.

they're also the sole income earner in a 3 person household but can only mark one of the others as a dependent for various reasons. they are forgoing pretty important medications atm for financial reasons.

they're currently looking for better employment and it has been brought to our attention that they might actually qualify for medicaid? (idk where the confusion was but they previously believed they did not qualify) so they're going to apply for that and hope for the best.

Should I convert my SIMPLE IRA into a Roth IRA before end of year?,"I'm 25 now. I started my SIMPLE IRA with previous employer in July, 2015.

Stopped working there in April, 2017. The money in the IRA (about $3k) has just been sitting there, growing slowly. I've heard how good Roth's are and I believe I meet the eligibility requirments so I'm wondering if now would be a good time to convert it.


For what it's worth, my income this year is pretty low as I only worked from Jan. - Apr. Stopped working to become a student.

Next year I'll be a student from Jan. - Sept. before starting work full time. 

So my tax burden is already low this year, I'm thinking why not convert to Roth now since it won't add much to my already low tax liability. Is there way to rollover into Roth without any of the 3k in my SIMPLE IRA getting included in my income?

"2 hour commute to work, should I move out or continue to save?","Hi everyone, I have a bit of a budgeting dilemma. I recently graduated college in May and moved back home to New Jersey to look for a full time job, which I just started in September. The only issue is the morning commute is a fun two hour drive. I have an opportunity to move closer to NYC (and my job) with some roommates but I’m really unsure if it would be the right move.

The job is a one  year contract hourly pay, with the possibility of being picked up for full time afterward, but I’m worried if I don’t get picked up I’ll be stuck with paying rent until next January.

I currently have 15,000 saved. Rent near NyC is expensive but the apartment we looked at would cost me 950 a month plus electric and cable.

The security deposit, brokers fee, and first months rent will be 2800 total. I figure furniture and kitchen/bathroom supplies will be another 750ish. 

My current take home each week fluctuates But is usually around 2600 a month.

I also have a girlfriend who is out in Philly for her masters and returning home in May, but wants to stay at home for a few years to save money. I might lose the opportunity to move since my potential roommates want to move ASAP, and I’m worried about being stuck living at home for the next three or four years.

Is my rent and other costs (groceries, laundry, car, etc) manageable with my current monthly take home? Should I go for it now to guarantee I have an apartment or should I try to wait until the year contract is up but risk not having anyone to move out with? Or do I just stay home with the gf of 4 years?

TL;DR: Can I trade in a car if I owe more than it’s worth?,"I hope it’s ok that I’m posting this here. 

In 2015 I bought a used car from a dealership for the first time. I wanted an SUV and needed something all wheel drive because my job at the time required me to be able to get around in the snow. The gas mileage on this beast is terrible (14mpg), which was ok at the time because I was working 10 minutes from home. 

Fast forward two years later and I’m working a different job now 45 minutes from home and I don’t have to worry about driving in the snow because I can stay home instead. 

I paid $15,900 for this car and while getting the paperwork together, the salesman kept telling me that it was mandatory to pay for gap insurance and something else I can’t remember, bringing my total amount borrowed to just under 20k. I had never purchased a car at a dealership before, so I believed this guy when he said I needed to pay for all of this extra stuff. 

I pay $320/month on the loan, and that isn’t bad. I can afford the payment. What I can’t afford is the insane amount of money I spend in gas each month driving 45 minutes to work every day at 14mpg. 

I would like to trade my car in and get something possibly cheaper and that gets better gas mileage. I’m pregnant now and need to cut costs where possible because I will not get a paid maternity leave and starting in January, my job will have me driving around more and spending less time in my office. 

Here’s the problem... Because I was stupid, I now owe more on this car than it’s worth.

Are there any options, or am I stuck with this car until I pay it off? I set up a 5 year payment plan for the loan, so it’ll be paid off in 2020.

I am a 22 year old college student in Georgia. I have recently inherited/acquired 20 acres about 4 hours away from my university. The land has a cell tower on it that is under lease.

Good finance = freedom + peace,"Sorry if this is off topic. I just wanted to share a personal victory, and how living in the wilderness made me love the power of financial planning 

I have been financially independent since 2012, making 27k-30k a year with health insurance in a median COL city.  I saved up money a few years ago and used it to go trekking in the rockies  (continental divide trail) for 5 months last summer. i was able to save money because I found the cheapest rent in the entire city and REFUSED to leave it for five years. it was the adventure of a life time and i am so happy i did it. 

Ironically, it was while I was living in the wilderness how I came to appreciate money so much. I was in awe at I could cover so many of my needs and problems  (hotels, replacement gear, lots of food, shuttles) with a little piece of plastic. I know this sounds very trivial, but understand that when I crawled into towns I would be very calorie-deficient, tired, crazy-eyed, and hyper aware (and desperate) of basic comforts. I would take out my debit card and get all my needs magically covered.  My bank account would take hits each month for health and auto insurance and hold strong.  I never had to crack open my other nest eggs. 

I just moved across the country and started a new job for 48k in a sorta expensive area. I was not paid for the first month. Moving was a lot more expensive than I thought it would be, because I had ZERO furniture, plates, cleaning supplies, etc. Even getting these things from goodwill adds up. i got a new bed, tv, and router. I felt sick and panicky at how much I was buying at once to furnish my 500 sq ft apartment at the very edge of town. I started paying with my credit card and, against better judgement, stopped looking at the balance until I was paid yesterday (my first paycheck in 6 months!).  I reluctantly opened my credit card statement... then realized I could pay it all on the spot!  And rent! And $1800 on repairs for my 10y/o car!

I think money really can buy happiness.  The only reason I could follow my dreams was because I had the funds for them set aside and prioritized.

No information is told in first person; it's always, ""I heard people are getting denied.""


So, has PILF personally worked for you? Or if you know someone personally with a PILF stories, would you mind sharing their experience? Thanks and happy new year!

Homeowner Connect Programs,"I've been on an unpaid medical leave for 6 months and have gone through savings, considering the ""homeowner connect portal"" because I do not have enough for mortgage.  Have never been late in 15 years.

I just read an article about people's homes being foreclosed after signing up for such programs. 

I've been in the appeal process with my employer short term disability company (sedgwick) I have systemic sclerosis and autoimmune liver disease- both diagnosed this year.  I have a hard time carrying out normal activities due to pain, feeling fatigued, side effects of immunosuppressants, have lost hearing in one ear and now have vertigo.  Waiting on SSDI process, been told the usual wait in my state (PA) is 21 months.

Feels like this homeowner option finding program is a deal with the devil. Advise needed on best way to proceed with dire circumstances.


I did take out a mortgage disability policy when I bought the house in 2002. But it is only $590 and my mortgage is $850.

Thank you
