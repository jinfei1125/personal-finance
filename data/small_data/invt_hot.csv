Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

2,Why I'm selling GME,"Because looking at the price action, it's $14,564 a share now and 2022 was a tough year for me. I had to build this time machine and it wasn't cheap so I have to cover my costs, I'm sorry.

I will take some of the proceeds and and donate it to the WallStreetBets Museum of Autism on 5th Avenue in Manhattan that opened last week; the original piss-drinking martini glass was amazing to see in person as was DFV's headband.

It's a bit lonely on earth now that the population has dropped by 9.4m but I will hopefully catch you on the next $TSLA moon flight next week. Can go to the MilkBar at Promontorium Archerusia and catchup on good old times when we used to live on earth?

8,True Short interest in GEE EM EE could be anywhere from 250% to 967% of the float. Yes short sellers are that fucking retarded.,"So my ~~colleague~~ wifes boyfriend, who has no reddit account and wishes to have no association with you autists, has been doing some maths (or ""math"" for you americans, or ""fun hobby time"" for our chinese autists) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume & trading volume. The base idea behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... so he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...

Here's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r more fuk than bears!<

""So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.

At first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...

So then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.

So from the FINRA report I got:

* Short Volume
* Short Exempt Volume
* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qvqwl2rw31m61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb1fbc9c5fbb7971d179d9f982ad75d54287d63

From Yahoo Historical Data I got:

* Total Trade Volume
* Day's Closing
* Day's low

Then I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)

* Long Volume (ExV - SV)
* SV% (TSV / EV)
* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)
* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)

I realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.

So I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \* $40).

If they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \* LV).

Then came to the conclusion of the data:

I wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:

* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.
* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.
* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.

&#x200B;

IN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.

The **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**

It is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.

I believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zyzechcy31m61.png?width=1275&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79ea03302ad64646162736f3f9a39843cc484fe

Because you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.

My point for my want is this: I**t is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons

&#x200B;

NOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.""

30,$GME DD : Technical Analysis shows Very Strong Buy Signals,"#  Intro

Welcome, and I hope everyone is fresh for a new day of holding because things seem to be getting interesting now. My take on this DD is a bit different to my usual format as I've decided to focus on the Technical analysis side of GME this time around. Why? Because you apes couldn't contemplate words so now I'm using colourful crayons and pictures instead. As always, I've inserted a TLDR for the autists but I do recommend reading it since it'll also help grow your knowledge of TA.

# Pivot Point

The pivot **point, support and resistance calculations are widely accepted as the simplest yet most effective trading strategy.** They are well trusted by traders, banks and all financial institutions as clear indicators of the strength or weakness of the market. *They are used as the basis for most technical analysis*. **The pivot point is the point in which the market sentiment changes from bearish to bullish.**

For example, let's look at the candlestick chart for a ticker that I took from tradingview,

&#x200B;

[Example Candlestick Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cdv56c1km0m61.jpg?width=873&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=83757b1f0769e06ca5f27ffeb1da8ac08bbe8601)

&#x200B;

R1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily Low

R2 = Pivot Point + (Daily High – Daily Low)

S1 = (2 x Pivot Point) – Daily High

S2 = Pivot Point – (Daily High – Daily Low)

*R3 = Daily High + 2 x (Pivot Point – Daily Low)*

*S3 = Daily Low – 2 x (Daily High – Pivot Point)*

**LINKING BACK TO GME**

&#x200B;

[Pivot Point Data were taken from Investing.com](https://preview.redd.it/rbjrco9nm0m61.jpg?width=976&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f917346de8cdbbc3f5e333edb8b6073831cd1a9)

&#x200B;

GME-

Resistance Line 1: $195.13

Resistance Line 2: 202.33

Resistance Line 3: 215.87

*While writing this post $GME was hovering around $217* in pre-market (Which is higher than the current R3 value), all though the value is bound to change before the market opens, if $215 can be maintained during the opening; that **will ultimately see Resistance Level 3 becoming the new support line. This would depict a very strong bullish trend that can be aided by the RSI (Relative strength index)**

*You can ignore the Fibonacci, camarilla etc PP if you're new to TA but they basically show the same trend of the ticker having an uptrend.*

# Relative Strength Index

*The relative strength index (RSI) is a* *momentum indicator* *used in technical analysis that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions* in the price of a stock or other asset. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator (a line graph that moves between two extremes) and can have a reading from 0 to 100

RSI below 30: Oversold, will rebound and may show divergence

Above 70: Overbought

&#x200B;

[GME RSI between march 4th and 8th](https://preview.redd.it/7ropbgzsm0m61.jpg?width=1201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c7ae49ff044332e81020f8404647aa973073a99)

Current GME RSI value: 68 (Neutral)

*The data shows RSI value continuing in an uptrend (bullish) and is in line with the price of $GME as no divergence could be seen. Coupling it with the pivot points, if the same trend continues today and tomorrow we'll see a breakout and support lines forming around $215+*

**Disclaimer: My predictions are just me speculating and do not necessarily mean they are right. The increased volatility with low float means the price could go in any directions. But the indicators seem to be showing a healthy direction for a bullish market.**

**Now comparing this to the RSI before January squeeze:**

&#x200B;

[RSI before jan squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/8otntoxum0m61.jpg?width=455&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fda45bc0fd98a78cea2e04d90c88ed9187a36d91)

&#x200B;

RSI Value: 72.14

As seen from the second image, RSI trend before the breakout was in an uptrend. However, the slope was not as steep as we're currently seeing right now and when the price really started getting high, RSI showed a massive overbought. Comparing this back to the march RSI, that trend is still in the neutral territory and has potential for a more violent uptick as RSI value reaches the 70-75+ region.

# Volume Weighted Average Price

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price security has traded throughout the day, based on both volume and price. *It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of security.* Large institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. **This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.**

*VWAP calculates the sum of price multiplied by volume, divided by total volume.*

&#x200B;

[VWAP January 13th-22nd](https://preview.redd.it/jcps124xm0m61.jpg?width=131&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=67dbb4877f7fa69b17429839bfa967c605d2b08d)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[VWAP March 1st-8th](https://preview.redd.it/s2sqhq2ym0m61.jpg?width=324&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2916f02390c863ea8b815eaca847d618766f51e)

&#x200B;

* Blue Line indicates the volume-weighted average price. **Comparing both pictures, the vwap value in regards to each candlestick seems to show the same pattern.**
* VWAP has been above the average day trading price between 6 and 7th March, this seems to act like the support line for the price.
* **8th march and 22nd January show a similar pattern, both had a relatively significant increase in (=increased volatility and more violent price swings) as well as a positive slope gradient.**

# Moving Average Convergence Divergence

MACD is a trend-following [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security’s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period [exponential moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ema.asp) (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the ""signal line,"" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. **Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line.**

&#x200B;

[MACD january](https://preview.redd.it/akhuo1g1n0m61.jpg?width=311&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=32ae04bfcde02eb35d592de58a87f48053cda122)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[MACD march](https://preview.redd.it/l0cu7ez2n0m61.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b836600d1bb2bac2c97aa6a10a97607381532f8)

&#x200B;

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) which graphs the distance between the MACD and its signal line. If the MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline.

* **MACD in January showed a gradual increase till breakout, the march macd value is much stronger in regards to the trend and can see the signal line deviating away from the EM**A. Linking it back to the RSI uptrend, trend seems to be bullish and does not show any signs of divergence. *Outcome? Will probably continue this trend for the days to come*

# Other Indicators

Since I ran out of time and probably you apes have ran out of patience as well, I'm just going to list the other moving averages indications to summarise the trends.

&#x200B;

[Indicator Values taken from trading view](https://preview.redd.it/dt8dgbo4n0m61.jpg?width=663&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=178b8def7cf54223bb626d78f7be1187159e0bd4)

&#x200B;

# TLDR

**Most (If not all) Moving average indicators show a very strong bullish market on a DAY scale as we can see the trend to continue to follow an uptrend. The Resistance level 3 pivot points may become the new support live if the RSI+MACD trend continues. Neither show divergence which is also a good sign.**

Anyways hope I've cleared some things out, and if the DD needs correction then please feel free to let me know so i can fix/include the data. **This is my last DD to the series and hope it has benefited people, I'll be taking some time off now to snort coke,** ***bon voyage*** **apes!**

34,"What will happen to the Global Economy if GME hits $1000, $5000, $10000, $50000, $100000+ per share?","I've been wondering about this for a while and nobody has brought it up. 

I keep seeing ""$50,000/share and $1,000,000/share is the new floor"". As far as I can tell, this would have huge repercussions on the Economy as there isn't enough liquid capitol globally to react to such a dramatic market cap.

At $1000/share, the GME market cap will be worth USD 69.8 Billion.

At $5000/share, USD 349B
$10000/share = USD 698B
$50000/share = USD 3.49 Trillion
$100000/share = USD 6.98 Trillion

Based on some DD by multiple people, SI could stand between 200-900% of the stock. Some say this makes the potential peak of GME share price infinite. Anything above $500,000/share (please correct me if I am wrong) could crash the global economy.

The impacts on the global economy will be massive, as shorts are required to liquidate Trillions of dollars out of diversified portfolios, resulting in a massive crash of prices all across the stock market. They will have to lean into credit as well, drawing potentially hundreds of billions to trillions in loans from banks, private lenders, and corporate and individual investors.

For a few weeks, we could see the entire global stock market drop by over 80%, as literally trillions of dollars trade hands, moving from Hedge Funds, banks, credit lines and money lenders into the pockets of retail traders.

This is terrifying not only to Hedge Funds but to everyone as they begin to realize the implications.

Leading valuation companies like Apple, Amazon, Walmart, Tesla, Facebook, etc., could have their value cut in half overnight, smaller companies could go bankrupt, and the list of world billionaires could be changed entirely.

If this happens, not only will Gamestop become the world's highest-valued company, but anyone investing in the company could pocket millions, even billions of dollars. If this happens, GME investors could be in a position to move this new wealth back into the companies that most deserve it, funding companies that have a vision and drive to make the world a better place, and fueling a new era of development on this planet.

That kind of money could resolve the climate crisis, eradicate poverty and global hunger, advance medical science, introduce a UBI and equalize the global standard quality of life, retrofit cities, regenerate the environment and ensure a livable future for all life on Earth.

Quoting Elon Musk, ""History loves irony, and the most entertaining outcome is the most likely.""

Please let me know if I am completely off my rocker. What do you think the impacts on the economy could be?

Then, Gamestonk. Game stonk became hope, it became a test, “am I brave enough to risk losing it all on a chance?”
I put every penny I had, 3K at 220 per share into Gamestonk. It was my first stock, ever.

It changed me. It made me brave. Holding through thick and thin. Solidarity with the community. The experience of buying and holding Gamestonk literally gave me the strength and courage to face my gender and begin transitioning. Now I’m a trans commie cat girl uwu and I fucking love this stock! 

To all the fellow retards on this sub. I love you, thank you. I spent years around “supportive spaces” and never felt half the solidarity I’ve experienced here. This community is something truly special. I really thought I’d lost the 3K in the process. But no, you guys actually came back for me, back to the frankly insane price I paid per share. Not only have I discovered an amazing community and my true self, I’m actually going to make money on this ticking crazy bullshit....or I would, if I ever sold.............

59,GME: are HFs let the stock price go up in the 500$ region - in a controlled way - so to finally convince paper hands to sell?,"Am I the only one seeing the potential for this new tactic by the HFs?

Instead of trying to push the price down, which coagulates more people in the battle (and eventually attracts even more retail investors), they could momentarily try to control the rise to 300-500$, so to give the (false) impression that the peak has been reached.

Transforming lots of people's hands in paper (EDIT 2: especially if the price then is pushed down quickly)?

It would be risky and probably cost millions, but it would also save TRILLIONS and - in the process of going up - the HFs will find a way to make money in any case.

Thoughts?

**EDIT 1** \--> **TL:DR** ""I will convince myself that the HFs have STARTED to lose control only when the stock will be above 10K.""

**EDIT 2** \--> ""Market Maker “A” with the FTD can work in collaboration with Market Maker “B”. “A” locates and borrows shares from “B”. However, “B” uses a naked short to supply the borrowed stock.

* “A” no longer has an FTD.
* “B” is now naked short the shares and has six days to find and locate.
* If “B” does not find and locate, they have an FTD. “B” then can buy the shares from Market Maker “C” who executes a naked short, ad infinitum.

This is called rolling over a position and can be done for a very long time. Obviously, it requires a conspiracy between Market Maker “A”, Market Maker “B” etc.

I'm a retard  posting on WSB with a bias due to having a large position in $UWMC. So, proceed on your own risk...)

I'll keep it short and simple... This is a one of a kind DD where the whole DD is basically a TLDR.

1-  It will potentially be included into the **Russell 1000 and 3000** on 03/22/2021.

2-  **Short Volume Ratio is 31%** (fintel). In addition, only 4,000 shares are available for shorting(for today, fintel). **0 were available yesterday.** To put things into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10, that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater, **that's considered extremely high**. We have 31% so a **short squeeze** is inevitable?

3- Forget about the short squeeze... It also have a very high potential of **gamma squeezing**. The open interest of calls is insanely high above 10$. Once it hits and stays above $10, the **gamma squeeze** could take it to a whole **new solar system**.

4- stock is massively **undervalued**, Fair value of UWMC as per Simply Wall Street = $19.76 - Currently going for $8.06$.

5- The CEO might appear on **Mad Money** this week or the next which would get it the exposure it needs for a short squeeze.

6-   Y2019 to Y2020 great earnings report and increase/growth overall. $UWMC is projected to have a better 2021 than 2020, and see an increase in EPS. This is opposed to $RKT(competitor), which is expected to see a large drop.

7- Borrowing rate has increased to 17.9% !! Where did we see this before??

**My short term Price target: 39$**

**Edit(The following is opinion and not financial advice or factual. Don’t act on it):** I’ve seen a lot of people comment about buying OTM 03/19 calls. You have to understand that there’s a likelihood that your money will burn and your calls will become worthless because MM’s who sold you the calls have large institutional % and can always pull the price downwards by selling their stocks. This ensures your calls expire worthless and they keep the money.

On the other hand, a person who buys stocks(not calls) is relatively safer(in my opinion) and will push the stock upwards(against MM’s) towards the +10$ where a gamma squeeze can potentially happen. In addition, bumping the stock up with buying shares could also potentially cause a short squeeze. The magic number is +10$!

In summary, the gamma squeeze and short squeeze both depend largely on buying stocks not calls in my opinion.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m17a0w/uwmc_when_the_squozes_keep_on_squoozing_and/,1615299395.0,941,941,0

86,"Why the Hedge Funds are fucked, and why we're winning so hard","So we've been steadily rising for days now, with barely a dip and I think I know why. No more shorting. 


Back in January the stock regularly plummeted, only to violently bounce back and it was scary as hell. Now we're just steadily rising, seemingly no end in sight. I think the hedgies are too scared to short it, which was their defense strategy last time. I believe that's what people were referring to with the whole ""short ladder attack"" thing. They borrow a whole bunch of shares to short, and when they sell them in large quantities, at the right moment, it causes large drops in the stocks price. This time is different. 


We're all prepared to ride this into the sunset, (others are willing to ride it all the way to the tippy top, and all the way back down to the ground), and we all know the power that we possess by holding. I bet they're just sitting back, too scared to short and end up being fucked even harder than they are about to be, and hoping for the best. Only problem for them is that there's no telling how far this could go. 


How many days of extremely low volume, yet drastic price increases are we going to go before something happens? What if no shares become available and no trades are happening at all? What if we peak at $69,690.69 and nobody is willing to sell because it's just so beautiful to leave the price right there!?


 I have no answer to any of these questions, but man, I can't wait to find out!

**INFO**

UWMC stands for United Wholesale Mortgage Corporation. They are a mortgage company similar to RKT. They fund mortgage loans through mortgage brokers and they take the interest. Many of you zoomers in college know interest very well. So do I.

At the moment of posting this stock is at about $8.40. It has a Market Cap of about 13 billion and is incredibly volatile at a volume of  11.68 million. It has an insane dividend of 4%. Still don't like the stock? Scroll down.

I will add an excerpt from another post. Credits will be below.

UWM reported 4Q20 net income of $1.37 billion and FY20 net income of $3.38 billion, an 821% and 715% increase over 4Q19 and FY19 respectively. This company is just getting started and has massive opportunity for growth. It was trading around $11 and got as high as $12 leading up to the earnings report? What happened after they released news that they absolutely crushed it? The stock plummeted, and it kept plummeting. It had maybe 4 green days out of 30 in the month after its earnings report. Why? Shorts. Who do I hate? The shorts!

97,What I learned as an inexperienced trader during $GME times,"Hello apes,  


I've been going in and out of GME for the last few months now.  
I wanted to share a bit of experience with you guys, to make things easier for everyone.  


Note that this is not financial advice, I'm just sharing my experience here.  


1 - Panic Selling ruins your gains.  
The biggest mistake I made during $GME is selling the stock when there were bigger drops.  
In most cases, it got pretty frustrating afterwards, when they had more profits than before. If you buy a stock - hold onto it, even if you have a loss.  


2 - Being impatient  
This directly correlates with the one above. I barely had any patience and trust in $GME - which is understandable, there is a lot of movement, but the most gains were done using patience.  


3 - Not informing myself when to get in our out  
I always noticed a lot of fluctiation around popularity. When $GME was less reported (for example, in news and generally less activity) it started falling, quite a lot. Especially once the news make fun of us apes for having losses.  


4 - Not checking out wsb  
The most motivating thing in this entire short squeeze was looking at this sub. All the memes made me strong, we are strong together. Believe it or not, those made me less stressed  


TL;DR: Don't panic sell, be patient, inform yourself and expect a falling stock once news make fun of WSB losses and check out WSB for memes to motivate you  


Thank you dear apes for reading this. Cheers 2021 millionares and good luck in life!

106,$GME $AMC Updating Catalysts and When Squeezes Collide,"Check my wall for other updates & DD, but this is simply in reference to what is happening this week and what DID happen this week.

1. DTCC proposed a new Rule that Willow allow them to charge Borrowing Interest and demand payment DAILY (Currently they only have to pay interest on shorted positions after expiration). This means the pain of stalling a short would be felt daily. This happened late on Friday and we weren't sure how it would effect the markets Monday, though most of us thought it would help....and it sure did.

2. GME had a massive update with Ryan Cohen leading a restructuring. When GME squeezes, we squeezes. This news showed that GME wasn't going away and people wanted in on the new big squeeze ($AMC)

3. Earlier it was announced theaters in L.A could open as early as next week.

3.5....^^^^ If they open a week from now it would be the same time period earnings come out which will serve as a catalyst. 

4. Earnings will show a Reconsolidation of debt and massive amounts of cash with great Management that will show the strength of $AMC and discuss their future pursuits. 

Add those two on top of each other (Succesful Earnings report + reopening LA) and we get a massive bump.

5. We popped $10 today. That means a lot of calls are waiting to execute on. And If we can finish this week at $15 the amount of calls is in the multiple millions which does NOT force a buy but it does generate interest in the stock and helps create buying pressure, and the more it goes up it creates increased Borrowing Interest which hurts the hedgies..

6. Quadruple witching next Friday. Look it up. 4 forms of contracts and expirations all at the same time.

""The question is whether the market is correct in taking these risks.

The economy is still probably trending at or below zero (the numbers will get screwy YoY for a while) due to huge insolvencies and a still restricted global economy; and structural unemployment is 6-10% (*i.e.,* whether you include the Labor Force Participation rate or not) showing how bad the picture really is. Debts have been temporarily forgiven but not permanently, so those payments are yet to come, and a LOT of demand for durable goods and housing has been brought forward. There is a high chance of payback, and the economy can't survive without stimulus.

The risks are (1) the market trying to price in higher rates (but likely to be capped by the Fed or by more sluggish growth) and (2) a strong potential for the dollar to rise. Both causes upset the speculative reflation party. Or it can wither away if growth comes in weaker than expected. I err towards a rising dollar and weaker growth over time, once stimulus fades.

But, the question I am wrestling with is whether we are even using the right denominator for assets anymore. The massive money printing doesn't show up in CPI due to demographics, debt loads, deflation effects of technology, or globalisation; but it does show up in assets. I'm starting to play around with the idea that the right way to understand what is really going on is to change the denominator to the Fed balance sheet for US equities, or the G4 Central Bank Balance Sheets for global stocks. Since QE started in 2008, stocks have basically traded sideways (*i.e.*, they have offset the balance sheet but have done no more than that).

Only technology stocks have outperformed the balance sheet since 2008 and that suggests that the tech trend is a secular trend, which also makes sense to me.

In gold terms, equities are fairly priced versus the long run average too.

Thus, I'm starting to think we are looking at 2 bubbles: a shorter-term bubble in reflation (that can be corrected by a sharp sell off), and the really big bubble that is distorting everything—central bank balance sheets. When viewed through those two lenses, everything since 2008 makes more sense.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1dcl2/margin_debt_is_highest_on_record_hedge_fund_gross/,1615316023.0,154,154,0

**TLDR; Volume, MACD, and Short Availability are all extremely bullish for GME. HODL 🚀🚀🚀🚀.**

Hang on to your bags, this puppy is going higher. The technicals all point BULLISH signals and signify GME is going much higher.

**Case 1 : VOLUME**

Look at the volume and price action for the last few weeks. Volume was actually decreasing from Feb 25 to Mar 3, and the price went UP, this is extremely bullish. Typically, if price stays flat or up on decreasing volume, this is bullish.

Secondly, since Mar 3, we have seen increasing volume with higher prices. This is bullish.

&#x200B;

[Holy shit! ](https://preview.redd.it/40z53odskvl61.jpg?width=467&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28bacefabefab34d59ba5a2cf2a64b132afdc484)

 

**Case 2 : MACD**

MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence and essentially shows the relationship between two moving averages. The crossover occurred when Ryan Cohen tweeted his infamous McDonald's vanilla ice cream cone photo (coincidence?). MACD shows strong momentum and is pointing GME to higher prices.

&#x200B;

[Looks Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/s30997zukvl61.jpg?width=493&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e200ddb9c0a88284cce5c7c430806e4eff11222d)

&#x200B;

 

**Case 3 : AVAILABLE SHARES TO SHORT**

From last Friday to today, the shares available to short have dropped a whopping 600,000 SHARES! Yet the price is up 35%+ today. This is extremely bullish, the shorts can't even drop the price given 600,000 shorted shares. Now keep in mind, this is counting the shares that are available to short, and does not include the millions of shares that are ALREADY shorted. If GME continues to climb higher, the short sellers may be margin called and forced to sell.

&#x200B;

[600,000 shorted! ](https://preview.redd.it/9aaem6vxkvl61.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2e0447f1c71e3c441110abad4bc6cb712b2627)

&#x200B;

 

**Final Thoughts**

There are a lot more tailwinds that can catalyze GME. This analysis doesn't even consider the possibility of another gamma squeeze or how many shares are now becoming ITM or ""In The Money"". This will require Market Makers to purchase additional GME shares if they don't have it in possession on exercise.

126,"It is time to return to tradition. Re-introducing the OG meme stock, $AMD. A play based on actual logic and not mindlessly flinging poo at a board to see what sticks.","**Advanced Micro Devices ($AMD) is undervalued, well positioned against competition, and poised to take further market share in rapidly growing and high demand industries.**

AMD is mainly known for its presence in the gaming industry, and some of you may remember it as one of the OG WSB meme stocks. This subreddit has seen the potential of AMD multiple times in the past, and I believe the recent AMD dip has created an excellent opportunity.

**First, let's look at how AMD compares to some of its competition:**

* If you are into PC gaming at all, you will be aware of how CPU sentiment has shifted greatly away from INTC in favor of AMD.

* The main reasons AMD CPUs are becoming more and more preferable are because they offer significantly more bang for your buck versus Intel CPUs, INTC has recently had disappointing new product releases, even high budget PCs are often abandoning Intel entirely.
[CPU Comparison](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/high_end_cpus.html)

* AMD just released new GPUs last week, which are superior in performance and more affordable than many of NVDA's top of the line models. Even though they are still high in price, this shows that AMD is very able and willing to compete with NVDA's top of the line GPUs. They sold out initially within a couple hours of release.
[GPU Comparison](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html)

* AMD produces both the CPUs and GPUs in both the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X. These consoles only just released a few months ago and will be in extremely high demand for the next 5 years or more.
[How AMD gained hold of the console market](https://itigic.com/ps5-vs-xbox-series-x-why-use-amd-cpu-gpu/)

NVDA Market Cap: $290B

INTC Market Cap: $245B

**AMD Market Cap: $89.5B**

Morningstar's research indicates that AMD's fundamental value is around $80 price per share. Meanwhile, they estimate NVDA's fundamental value to be around $330 price per share. Morningstar's estimates tend to be conservative, yet even after this correction that tech has endured, most tech companies remain well above their fundamental value - except AMD.

**As I am typing this, AMD is currently under $75 price per share. Even if AMD somehow had extremely minimal future growth (I will further outline why future growth will actually be astronomical), it would still fundamentally be valued at $80 per share AT LEAST, and that's with boomer estimates.**

I don't claim that NVDA or INTC are bad companies, rather I seek to point out that AMD is being underestimated by Wall Street. There's more than enough room for all of these companies to have a future in the gaming industry and adjacent industries.

[The gaming industry experienced record growth in 2020, and isn't stopping any time soon.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/videogames-are-a-bigger-industry-than-sports-and-movies-combined-thanks-to-the-pandemic-11608654990)

I see some claims that the end of lockdowns will mean less people playing video games or using computers, I don't think this claim is even worth seriously addressing. If you seriously think that you may be a little out of touch.

**Other Industries AMD Will Succeed In**

While my primary focus has been on AMD's success in the gaming industry, their GPU's are also widely used for mining the digital currencies that cannot be named or discussed on this subreddit, but it is still worth mentioning that market and the large demand that it brings. We've also seen NVDA branch off into the autonomous driving and AI industries, AMD could easily do the same.

[AMD CEO, Lisa Su, has previously expressed interest in branching towards EV and AI industries, and says AMD's technology is already there. (This is the best link I can find at the moment)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/b4w1hm/is_amd_getting_more_serious_about_autonomous/)

**Semiconductor Shortage?**

Some people cite the recent semiconductor shortage as a reason to be bearish on AMD and related companies. While this is an issue, it is clearly short term, and I think these shortages have been more than priced in by now, especially for AMD. [Demand is extremely high, which is good, and AMD is working on increasing their capacity.](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/lisa-su-shortages-constrained-amd-s-record-2020-and-will-continue) Lisa Su says she expects shortages to ease the second half of 2021, adding that they will have added capacity in the second half of 2021.

The demand for AMD products is extremely high, this is clearly bullish in the long term. AMD’s technology will continue to be very valuable in many industries, the potential for growth here is still astronomical. Lisa Su is a great CEO who has brought AMD in a great and very competitive direction, and there are few CEOs better suited to successfully navigate any future speedbumps.

If that still doesn’t sooth your mind, [the Biden Administration has already committed to easing the shortage.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html)

**Positions?**

I tried to keep this analysis relatively short and sweet. I believe I have made a compelling case to be bullish on AMD in the coming months/year. IV on $AMD calls at the moment is extremely low, historically low. As low as 45% on many, making this a great time to buy, shares are also a fantastic choice. I recommend you give yourself enough time in case AMD continues to dip along with the rest of tech, but YOLO to your heart’s content if you wish to do so.

$AMD $100c 7/16, $AMD $120c 01/21/22

**TL;DR: AMD is undervalue, buy calls or shares**

129,"For the first time since I invested in GME, I’m actually starting to make some money from it","

I bought my first share of GME on January 29th for $319.18. It went up maybe 5 dollars after that, and then it all crashed. I bought a few more shares as it went down, but I was honestly wondering if I’d made a huge mistake and just wasted my money on a dumb meme. I got my average cost down to $181.14, and I was planning on getting a few more shares later since I didn’t think it would be moving from the $40s any time soon. 

I was wrong, and I was honestly shocked to see the price quadruple in the past two weeks. It was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. I haven’t made the hundreds of thousands of dollars that some people on here have, and I still don’t think GME will get me anywhere near that much. But for someone who has never made more than $10 an hour, any free money is more than welcome.

This is perfect for any newbie trying to understand what is going on and how the system has ended up the way it has.

Tl;Dr at end.

There are many great DD's that clearly explain Naked Shorting in 3-4 sentences that we can all agree are great. **However while looking around for DTCC ownership** and after having found [The Oil Drum](http://theoildrum.com/special/archives) (a great archive of oil related information/discussion btw), **Cede and co** which was brought to my attention a month ago. I dismissed it as a conspiracy theory until I saw the post a couple days ago **(credit:** u/bEAc0n) bringing them up again and I took it seriously for once, which then led me to try and find a website like The Oil Drum but for Shorting.

This website is run by a **dude called Larry with 40 years of WS experience, ex-Goldman Sachs EVP, Board Member, Director of Equities+Income** and so on, he clearly brings up and explains the implications of everything to do with Naked Shorting and how it plays out in the market. You can look around his website but all he really talks about other than the Shorting is Pharmaceuticals/Bio-tech.

I sent him an email and this was his response

This is the important part: a quote from Part 8 if you dont want to read the whole series

>**While you may think you are buying registered stock, you are actually buying a financial derivative related to that stock.** **Effectively, you are buying a financial derivative from brokers of a financial derivative they hold from Cede that is just a digital entry in your DTC account.**  
>  
>Cede is at the center of the current, paperless electronic trading system that enables lightning fast trading of large blocks of stock by institutional investors and computers. Unfortunately, the intention  in designing it was to provide liquidity and reduce settlement risk. There is virtually no transparency in the system. Disturbingly, there are loopholes which allow for the counterfeiting of shares by market makers on a massive scale through illegal naked shorting and other measures. **At present, there is no way for an outsider or even the securities industry’s regulator, the SEC, to meaningfully detect and track these counterfeit shares. Once created counterfeit shares go on to be treated the same as legitimate street name shares**

**TL;DR: until the people at the top (aka CEDE and co) are brought into court/subpoenad we will never ever have a truly free financial system, they control everything and it is up to them to decide how and where the stock market goes. Their company valuation is somewhere in the region of $34T as of 2019 IIRC yet it is a private firm??? This means some very big people and organisations are playing a very big game that we are not a part of.**

I closed all of my positions with $AAPL while the market was in decline and now I'm going to be going back in full force.  


The first major item here is the news that there may be a virtual event on March 23rd (this is why I'll be looking at picking up some March 26th expiration calls that are close to ATM).

&#x200B;

1. Rumor of an [Apple](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/08/apple-event-march-23-kang/) even on March 23rd, some items that may be coming:
   1. [AirTags](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/) \- not that exciting, just their version of Tile
   2. [AirPods](https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/15/60-million-airpods-sold-in-2019/) \- Apple has sold 60 million of these in 2019....that's 71% of true wireless headphone revenue
   3. Potential for new Mac / iPad updates. The iMac Pro has been discontinued so it's possible they make an announcement around a Mac product here.

Company Fundamentals:

* From the above you'll see they have a commanding share of the true wireless headphone market. Any additional updates to the AirPods would be a great revenue generator. As much as people roasted the over the ear AirPods max...they're sold out everywhere and people were paying 2x the price to get them off eBay.
* Looking below there is a steady increase in revenue from the iPad, Mac...and significant growth from ""other"" which would be your AirPods, and other accessories.

For those of you who understand how the 10yr relates to equity markets and how inflation = bad news for Apple...It's trading at an attractive P/E right now compared to other companies. It has a lower P/E than Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Adobe etc.

https://preview.redd.it/cfh8d1qw32m61.png?width=2846&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3a0c4692e6c980db9f6d851249503bb4e14cd4e

They had their best earnings report ever last quarter, and the stock dropped after, and continued to do so from $140's down to a low of $116 yesterday.

Apple is below it's price it entered 2021 at, which to me flashes a huge buy sign as this is oversold. While tech might not have growth like it did in 2021, and just because $AAPL has mountains of cash, I don't think any pending inflation fears should sway anyone away from thinking this is as blue chip as you can get.

170,Amazing Apes: Why WSB unironically gives me hope for the future,"I don't need to recap how Shitadel and Vlad conspired to fuck you all over by restricting trading, but I will talk about their reasoning. Why do something so blatant that it pisses off your customers and grabs the attention of Congress?

You see, as attention spans grow shorter and shorter, PR consists more and more of just distracting people for a tiny amount of time. If you can ride out a PR crisis for a few days, you're in the clear. There's always some other bullshit to pay attention to. So they bet their app and their reputations on this: if they could distract WSB for a few days, everyone would forget about GME. Sure some devoted apes would be on here throwing their turds around, but the power of the masses would be dissipated, never to return.

Ironically, it's you retards who proved conventional wisdom wrong. They threw everything they had at you, and you stayed focused and strong. They tried precious metals, an artificial dip, and constant negative media attention, but you all kept your eyes on the golden banana. You showed that millions of apes together cannot be distracted or dissuaded from their goal.

Here's looking at you apes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1adnc/amazing_apes_why_wsb_unironically_gives_me_hope/,1615308039.0,130,130,0
171,"If you don't want WSB to be perceived as one entity, or a certain stock to be perceived as a P&D scheme, then stop bullying people for their trading decisions","I  get it. You want our darling stock to go to the moon. I do too - I held  25 shares from $300 up to $483 and back down, and I averaged down holding all the way to the 30s and now I'm holding 170 shares. I intend to keep holding them. But when you call people bitches or pussies for taking a profit, you are giving ammunition for anyone to call WSB a plump and dumpling (actual words forbidden) forum, because those tactics are what plump and dumplingers use so they can exit confidently at the highest price. You're also feeding the narrative that WSB is acting as a single entity because you're deliberately trying to coerce someone into taking a particular action by verbally harassing them.

So here's my advice: if you *are* trying to P&D our favorite stock, then fuck off. If you aren't, let other people make their own decisions without being bullied, but try to explain to them why it's in their interest to not be a 🧻🤲.

See you on the moon friends. Please be respectful.

EDIT: my title is not specific enough. Someone pointed out in the comments that there's always been bullying on WSB - people bullied DFV. This is part of WSB's blood and really I don't have a problem with it. What I specifically take issue with is using insults to coerce people into not selling *to increase your own profits.* I get that you're not trying to take profits at the bullied person's expense, but to someone from the outside, that distinction isn't obvious. And it very well may end up being at the other person's expense depending on how this all shakes out. Let's not pretend we're not taking risks here.

187,$400-Range Action: Hold,"As a lurker, I’ve read many DD posts and am incredibly excited about the progress of GME. However, I’ve noticed many are comparing the stock’s progress to the end of January, using that as a basis for the rocket to take off for the squeeze this month.

I believe the rocket will take off, and I believe it will be to tremendous values. But I caution anyone who is looking at January’s action as a reference to be resilient, because it’s possible that some will view any significant dips as manipulation similar to what RH did at the end of January, and end up panic-selling. I’m certainly no expert at these matters and who knows what crap can and may be pulled, but be strong, and don’t assume that when we hit the $400 range that any significant dips are manipulation that require VERY-premature selling.

TL,DR: Hold past the $400 range, don’t sell on dips there, regardless of January manipulation.

206,PT for Friday 3/12/2021 $388,"**TL;DR PT for Friday 3/12/2021 $388**

I'm refraining from mentioning the ticker name on purpose

Here our my thoughts on a PT of $388 for Friday 3/12/2021

By drawing a line in sand for multiple points in time I can calculate the change in price related to volume.

The two most notetable points in time for me was the [trading halt](https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/buying-stocks/articles/why-are-brokers-halting-gamestop-trading/) on 1/28/21 and when [DFV doubled down](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lnqgz8/gme_yolo_update_feb_19_2021/) on 2/19/2021. The time between these two events was exactly 21 days. Thus using 21 days I back tracked to 1/6/2021 for a basis of price and volume change up to the trading halt. I then used 21 days to estimate where I will be 21 days from DFV's double down ; we are currently on day 18 and day 21 will be Friday 3/12/2021.

First I calculated price change by looking at the open and close price for each event

Price change = Close Price - Open price

This tells me how much price action took place over a given event

&#x200B;

|Event|Start|End|Days|Open|Close|Price Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Start|1/6/2021|1/27/2021|21|$18|$348|$329|
|Trade Halt|1/28/2021|2/18/2021|21|$325|$41|$(284)|
|DFV + 50k|2/19/2021|3/9/2021|18|$41|$236|$195|

Next I looked at the price change related to volume for each Event.

Volume / Price change = Volume / abs (Close price - Open price)

abs = absolute value

This tells me how much volume was needed to change the price $1

As you can tell the amount of volume required to move the price during Event 3 is slightly less then Event 1. Also the amount of volume required to move the price during Event 2 is significantly less due to the trading halts imposed on retail investors.

&#x200B;

|Event|Volume|Price Change|Volume / Price Change|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Start|1,108,040,000|$329|3,366,368|
|Trade Halt|569,480,000|$(284)|2,003,025|
|DFV + 50k|624,115,325|$195|3,193,876|

Finally I can calculate what my price target will be at the end of event 3 on 3/12/2021

I look at how much volume I have left to go on event 3 based on Event 1

Volume To-Go = Event 1 Volume - Event 3 Volume

I then take my volume to go and divide that by how much volume it has taken during event 3 to move the stock $1

Volume To-Go / Volume/Price change = (Event 1 Volume - Event 3 Volume) / (Event 3 Volume / Event 3 Close Price - Event 3 Open price)

This tell me how much I expect the stock to rise by the end Event 3 on 3/12/2021

&#x200B;

|Volume To-Go|Volume To-Go / Volume/Price change|Current Price|Price Target for Friday 3/12/2021|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|483,924,675|$152|$236|$388|

Lastly, now that I have my expect price change I can calculate my PT for Friday 3/12/2021

**Price Target for Friday 3/12/2021 = Current Price + (Volume To-Go / (Volume/Price change)) = $388**

All the Data shown above has been taken from 3 month charts ; except 3/9/2021 which was taken around 1:15 pm CST on 3/9/2021 once the day closes I can re run this model if need be. Also everything was rounded to the closest whole number.

The whole scenario here is still so unprecedented ; as more volume and price action takes place I can update my models accordingly and make adjustments. But as we get closer to the apex of price I really think we could start seeing $100 ,$1,000 , maybe even $10,000 mid day price swings in either direction.

Some food for though that I might expand on later is so far during event 3 we are starting to see a smaller requirement of volume needed to change price. This separation could be a sign that significant price action could be taking place soon.

This is not financial advice ; I'm not a financial advisor ; I'm not saying to buy or sell.

**But based on historical trends $388 is where I expect to see this stock come Friday 3/12/2021.**

208,Why brokers are not accepting limit orders at prices far above last traded price.,"After moving from RH, I was getting frustrated that TDA and other brokers wouldn't let me place set it and forget it limit orders for GME at really high prices.  I only wanted to sell a few shares at $500 to cover my cost basis and diamond hand the rest.  I called up their trade desk to see if they would let me do it over the phone, no dice. The explanation they gave me was that it is not their call, it is the market makers that reject the orders if they try to place them that far away from last traded price.  The broker claimed that the MM's have finite bandwidth on their order books, so if they allowed limit orders to get on their books that far away from the market price, then it could cause issues for people trying to trade at the market price like cancelled market orders and not getting fills at market price.  Since the MM's don't think that it's possible for the price to moon that quick so there's no chance of ever being filled they don't allow those limit orders to go on their order book so they can conserve bandwidth for orders they think have a chance to be filled.  Which, LOL, then why are you placing trade restrictions on 0DTE options and why does the option chain have significant volume at the $800 strike for end of this week?  I did test this to see if it was true both ways. I tried to place a limit buy for GME on TDA at $1 price, and it rejected that for being too far from market price.  Does anybody know the mechanics of how MM order books and fills work to confirm whether this ""bandwidth"" claim is legit?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1esm0/why_brokers_are_not_accepting_limit_orders_at/,1615319911.0,46,46,0

# Ok, so what am looking at?

This is a plot of all open option contracts on GME. For those not familiar, in the simplest possible terms, an option is a contract to either buy or sell 100 shares of a stock at a price that you chose (the **strike**), and at a date that you also choose (the **expiry**). An option that will allow you to *buy* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *call*. An option that allows you to *sell* 100 shares at your chosen price and future date is called a *put.*

Since an option is a contract, two parties are required: 1.) The option seller/writer, and 2.) the option buyer. For every contract, there has to be a buyer and seller. So when you buy a contract, you are literally buying the *option* to buy or sell 100 shares of a stock.

On the other side of the contract, someone had to sell it to you. They are therefore taking your money in exchange for *maybe* having to provide you with 100 shares of stock if the price of the stock moved in your favor. 

The black lines/boxes in the plot represent the number of contracts 'open'. This means two parties have agreed to buy/sell an option contract between them at a given strike price and expiry date. If the contract is open, that means the buyer is still waiting on the stock price to move in their favor. If it doesn't move there before the expiry date, then the contract is worthless and the seller of the contract made money on the buyer. The dotted black line represents the price at time of writing. 

# So what does the data show then?

It shows a ton of contracts open at really extreme strike values. Right now there is a huge demand for GME contracts, so the price of *any* contract at *any* price is high. It appears that people are buying/selling a ton of put contracts at very low strikes. 

This means two things:

1. The people buying these contracts believe GME will crash down to these low values. They could also be people with lots of stock buying them to offset the risk if it crashes before they expect.
2. The people selling these contracts believe that even if the price of GME drops, it will never hit these low prices. Because all options are expensive right now, the sellers of these options stand to make a good profit if GME stays above $20. 

[Huge number of open put contracts below $20, expiring in mid April.](https://preview.redd.it/uy9h07dp41m61.png?width=1992&format=png&auto=webp&s=989a1b58ecf02ca8da5bead1d4ccb85d970328a9)

There are also some call options being bought sold at very high strikes, but nowhere near the volume of puts. The risk associated with selling calls is probably too great.

# Get to the point monkey

It is my opinion that people or hedge funds are selling huge amounts of way ""out-of-the-money"" (low strike value) puts to try and make profit off of apes who think GME will crash in a month. It is also possible someone knows something I don't. Regardless, this information teaches us something interesting.

Whether we have 1 share or 10,000, we the Redditors are their target market. With Cohen and their transition from b&m to online retailer, what could possibly be better than worldwide headlines and the admiration of all of us? 

They know we will always have many choices  when buying games online. What could possibly better for GameStop than creating life long, untold loyalty with all of us young, internet savvy investors? Plus all of the headlines, movies and the impact on pop culture. What an opportunity for Gamestop! I believe they have massive skin in the game and want to see this happen more than any of us. They are not going to throw a bone to Wall Street and fuck us over - can you imagine how well that would fare for their Cohen, his investment and their transition to online retailer?

258,Today's $ACAD overcorrection could be an opportunity," 

Posting what might be a good options opportunity. Pharmaceutical company $ACAD went from $45/share to $24/share between close and open today. [The reason for this is the FDA has found postmarket and labeling deficiencies in their application for pimavanserin](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/acadia-analysts-cut-targets-as-fda-sees-application-deficiencies/ar-BB1epjWt). The company has until 4/3 to correct the issue.

That said, I believe the overcorrection today was massive. Even without this new drug on the market, the company still has Nuplazid in it's portfolio and 2019 revenue of $339 million. Their average share price over the past 5 years is $32.63 . 

The following price target changes were made in light of this news.  However, the stock has *immediately* pulled below even the least optimistic target.

* Stifel - DOWNGRADE from $68 to $27
* Jefferies - DOWNGRADE from $62 to $40
* Cantor - DOWNGRADE from $70 to $45

I see a lot of opportunity to make money with calls beyond April, where the position of the company will be more clear. If the deficiency is corrected prior to 4/3, the stock is almost guaranteed to go above $40 again. Since the nature of the deficiency is not yet disclosed, it could be something easily remedied.  Even if not, The current market price has overcorrected. A safe bet would be to balance long calls with April puts.

Example: June 18 $25c @$4.25 has a break even point of $29.25 at expiry.  Should the deficiency be corrected prior to April 3rd, this option has a 170% upside.

267,The case for PLTR!,"The case for PLTR!

What does it do?
Many investors in PLTR have no idea what the company actually does to make money. Putting it as simply as I can the company creates software for companies to analyse data and create simulations which help companies or governments make decisions which will help them strategies. For example they take all the data regarding COVID infections and help governments predict how it might spread which will allow them to distribute vaccines to the areas that will reduce the spread of the virus the most.

Financials
The company should be profitable either in 2021 2022. In 2020 the company had a one off cost of almost $1 billion for stock based compensation for its employees. The companies revenues are increasing 30% year over year and the losses are decreasing every year. When it does become profitable the profits will increase rapidly. As CEO Alex Karp has explained their has been a wide divergence between the Revenues and costs which is typical with tech companies that need to spend a large amount of money in the beginning for product development and make large profit margins once they have a working product. The revenues are currently at just over a $1 billion dollars with a loss of $1.17 billion in 2020 however when you look at the reason for this it’s mainly because selling and admin costs aswell as research and development. Now what needs to be understood about the financials of Palantir is that although there is a divergence in revenues and costs there is not and with the product and systems they currently have there will not be in the future a scenario where there cost of revenues are flat and the revenues increase. This is because the software has to be adapted to each of its customers which requires time and money. That being said the company currently has a gross profit margin of 75% and considering the average customer pays $7 million this is not concerning at all.

Technology or Consulting Firm
As explained above the company does need to personalise its software based on the customers needs and the cost of revenues are not flat however I don’t think you can reasonably argue this is a consulting firm. The company may need to personalise its software for each customer for its commercial clients but this is just an set up fee and from then on the company is making large profit margins. With its government clients I’m assuming their is very little personalisation to the software that is needed and they can simply input the same variable data that previous government agencies have inputted and run there simulations if they are looking for the answer to the same question for example what areas should we distribute the COVID vaccine to first?

The End Game!
Palantir is a long play for me. In the short term this company could go up to 40 or back down to 15. Any lower and I’m selling my house to buy as much as I can. But as Alex Karp said over the long term he thinks Palantir will be one of the most important technology companies in the world and its long term share holders will benefit greatly. This reminded so much of Jeff Bezos back in 1999 talking about Amazon’s long term view. I think Palantir is a great company over the long term and in 10 years time I think the share price will be at least $250 based on its growth rate.

I welcome any criticism of my analysis, I know it’s not a complete analysis but if I were to do that I’d be here all day. I think I’ve included the most important points anyway.

276,"What brokers y’all use? Robinhood cucked me way too many times, fuck them and citadel","As title says. Robinhood literally never executes my options without a massive wait. I just was day trading some BAC options and I’ve run into two problems.

1. They lying:
Idk if anyone has run into this issue and as retarded I may be I wouldn’t do it twice. Both times I was day trading BAC. Essentially I go to double down and instead of buying more it executed a sell and closes my positions or when I go to exit my position it would make me buy more instead of closing the position. I could be retarded here but I wanna know if it’s me that’s the problem or if it’s robinhood doing some fuckery. So have y’all had a similar issue?

2. They won’t execute my orders:
I’ve had now several problems where BAC locks me out of profit by not letting me execute orders. Now I trade stuff that’s LIQUID AF aka BAC. The contract I was trading had nearly 6k OI and 13k in volume. It’s the $26 March 12 put. I had my order sat at $29 for nearly two minutes and it didn’t execute while the price indicated $29 for the put during the whole 2minutes. That may not sound like a lot but it is if ur day trading. Long story short BAC reverse and I ended up selling for a massive loss compared to unrealized gain. I also got cucked on RKT since I bought debit spreads and robinhood refused to let me sell them. The stock went up 70% but robinhood didn’t let me sell them for 20% gain and my spreads were ITM deep and liquid.

Edit: I remembers I had more dirt on robinhood

3. They openly steal:
So I notice this whenever I day trade options and currently I can see it in my portfolio as clear as day. They will tell you “we sold your contract for $25” and you bought at $24 so why the fuck is there less than $1 gain in my portfolio. Big money might not notice this but they literally steal in pennies from your options order. Tell me you executed at 24.98 if u want to steal those two pennies and don’t lie to me. This one HAS to be illegal unless they have some fine print covering it cuz as far as I know options are only traded in dollars and not pennies so why are two pennies being stolen when is supposed to be “FrEe TrAding”

I’m looking for a broker that’s free or has reasonable fee’s for options trading with a friendly interface. I don’t care for charts since I use trading view and coin flips. 

I need four things:
1. Buy button
2. Sell button

1: A lot of comments about where to buy IPO. To answer this, wait until market close today, and look for publications/press release from the company itself, as they are making this IPO available in the form 199 million stock tomorrow morning. 

2: Second thing I’ve seen is quite a few people asking about buy in, and to set the record straight as far as I’ve seen, the share price is somewhere between 35-120. Making me think that they are not sure what they are going to list at quite yet. 

3: This stock is going to be retail driven. There are some publications stating that this may go poorly, but the most accurate article (in this apes opinion) is that this stock may actually be a solid investment for those looking to invest.

I have literally never made a real post here, and I am NOT giving financial advice. I just like the stock. Also first DD, hope I did this right.

289,Dumb Money or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Stocks,"Gather round degenerates, and be prepared to celebrate prematurely.

There is no feeling quite as gratifying as being told again and gain that you’re a fucking idiot, and you’re fucking wrong, only to watch your stupid ass plays make you more money than should be humanly possible, and in such a short period of time.

I should know, I’ve gotten to ride this train twice now. And I’d like to share some lessons that I have learned and relearned, only to constantly learn that every lesson I’ve ever learned in the stock market has been wrong.

1) When everyone is an idiot, no one is an idiot. I have seen time and time again that the smarter a person thinks they are, the less money they tend to make. The more sure they are about something happening, the less likely it is to happen. I couldn’t tell you why, but I can tell you that people say that /u/DeepFuckingValue is *objectively a bad trader* for not selling literally his entire position the last time it was at the top. $50000 to $10 Million dollars is, objectively, success. And that is what he has realized at this point in time.

2) IT IS NEVER BAD TO TAKE PROFITS. Some of you are probably looking at positions that have increased 2, 3, 10, or even 50 fold (especially you, people who bought options when GME was below $100 per share again and IV was lower) closing a portion of your position to recoup your initial investment is not greedy, it is the opposite. Pigs get slaughtered, and that is absolutely the truth. Selling 25% of your stake in a company to make sure that no matter where a stock ends up, you are still above your entry point, is a good thing to do. Don’t believe me? Believe DeepFuckingValue, who did literally this. Specifically with his options. Those are going to go down in value with time AND with descreased IV when the stock calms down (even if it calms down WAY above the strike price) and those are probably the best way to take your gains. And nothing is stopping you from reinvesting in GME. But if your entire life depends on that money, if you’re investing your mortgage or your loans or anything more than you can afford to lose, for fucks sake, why would you want to live with all of that stress?

3) No one has your best interests at heart but yourself. Yes, that’s right, me included. It is dangerous to openly share your positions with identifying information, and it is also dangerous to make your decisions entirely off of what someone else is doing.

4) Set your own sell prices. It doesn’t matter if it’s $500, $1k, $10k, or any fucking number. Pick a price to sell a portion of your position at the very least, and do it. Yes, I know I’m being sacrilegious by mentioning a number that is MORE THAN TEN TIMES WHERE THE STOCK WAS TWO WEEKS AGO, but this goes to the most important and simple rule.

5) I don’t know nothing, you don’t know anything, no one knows anything about the future. It is all speculation. The only thing that is real is the gains you have actually taken, and the only way those are real is if you realize them. I’m not, I REPEAT, I am not telling you to sell or to close any of your positions, but to have a point where you are comfortable selling at least a portion of them and stick to it. It helps me sleep at night, I’ll tell you that.

Dear Apes.

Watching the GME stock market launch from my POV in the side lines is the best euphoria I had in a long time. I wasn't there when Apollo 11 got to the moon and this is just as good if not much better.

One of my triple monitor setup is dedicated to the GME stock in tradeview and this subreddit since January this year, the other monitors are for porn and stuff. Watching all the bs in the mainstream media has also been a hell of a show, made some popcorn a few times and i'm loving it, this event is already in my history books and i feel this is just the beginning.

I share these words with you brave wonderful apes with the intention to show my respect and appreciation to all mammals playing diamond hands in this game. Thank you all and keep up the good fight!

OK, UNFI is the biggest food wholesaler in the US. They're currently at $30.97/share (earnings tomorrow AM). Back in 2015 they peaked at $83.04. Then they nose dived because $AMZN bought Whole Foods $WFD and everyone thought Amazon was going to replace UNFI and self-supply. 


Weellll turns out food logistics is pretty fucking complicated. Whole Foods has used UNFI as their primary distributor for years and extended their contract with UNFI last week through 2027:
https://www.supermarketnews.com/retail-financial/unfi-re-ups-primary-distribution-pact-whole-foods


The other reason the stock was beat down was that $UNFI bought SuperValu (grocery chain) which came with some baggage, mainly union pension requirements. 


I'm taking from DOMO Capital's Seeking Alpha a little bit, but from 2014-18 SuperValu traded at avg 7 EV/EBITDA and UNFI traded at avg 11 EV/EBITDA and somehow when UNFI buys SuperValu they go down to a 5.78 EV/EBITDA? Most mergers increase stock price, but what do I know I'm actually a gorilla. 


Grocery revenues continue to be up from the pandemic, so an earnings beat tomorrow is likely. 
On top of that, 85% of outstanding UNFI shares are owned by institutions and it's heavily shorted. 

Float = 51,210,000

Shares shorted = 12,280,000

Shares that aren't insider/institutionally owned = 6,298,830

I don't want to pull from the GME rally, but maybe a good place to put your moonrocks when you're ready. 

I bought $5,400 of Jan 2021 $45 calls yesterday.

310,RBLX 🚀🚀 Direct Opening DD - Please Learn Why this is NOT an IPO Before You Make Any Moves," 

Here is a load of non-advice horseshit from an idiot who knows nothing, but has been watching RBLX and just read an Investopedia Article on Direct Listings:

A lot of people seem concerned about where RBLX's opening price will be pinned. This is the wrong question. RBLX is doing a Direct Listing; all existing shares become tradeable by whomever holds them, subject to some restrictions. Essentially, employees and VC's get their first chance to cash out.

The price will therefore be dependent upon market forces rather than any particular price target set by an underwriter. Unlike an IPO, there is no underwriter here. It can't ""open"" until a bid-ask has been filled.

RBLX's price action therefore depends on the incentives of insiders currently holding the stock tonight, on RBLX Eve. More sophisticated VCs and investors might want to hold some if they see a heavy price target. **VCs** might also want to do some profit taking - they've already made a ton on RBLX and would probably want to diversify.

**Employees** have been working around the clock for however many years (at least four, if they want to achieve total vesting of all their equity). In my view, many would have no interest in holding RBLX for value - they would likely want to cash in their chips. Their shares were literally worthless to them until RBLX went public, so in a way, $45 is as good as $100 - they hold thousands and thousands of shares, and are about to become very rich after working tons of hours. Even if it dips, you might see more sales from employees who are like: ""EFFIT I GAVE MY LIFE TO THESE TINY BLOCKPEOPLE SHITBAGS I MUST HAVE MY TENDIES"". When your shares were essentially free, $35 is appealing, particularly if price is dropping.

A selloff shouldn't be unexpected. Of course, aggressive meme-buying is also to be expected. But which side holds more weight?

In my view, the profit-taking motive will be stronger at the beginning; eventually, retail memes will win out. I am HEAVY bullish on RBLX longterm, and want to own as many shares as I can. But in the first hour or two, expect wide bid-asks, low liquidity, and maybe even a decent dip.

I of course, expect nothing but 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 in the longterm. But if you want to open your position in tendietown, it's good to think about entries.

**TL;DR:** 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 LONGTERM but expect swings and lots of opportunities to build positions; but just in case, I'm going to use 25% of my RBLX fund immediately at open when everyone is skittish.

So far so good: up 1x Stimmy+.

Still holding and not selling... I'm just too stupid to take profits here.

I will be too busy posting memes and watching movies this week to sell. I'm also too broke to buy popcorn now that everything is maxed out, so I'll just bring a box of crayons into the AMC theater with me and try my best not to leave a rainbow colored wrapper mess on the floor.

Today Acadia Pharmaceuticals had some bad news from the FDA with one of there new drug applications. The FDA delayed the approval but did not deny it. Due to this the stock dipped immensely taking and over 40% loss today. Here is the part where I say it doesn't matter and to buy the dip. $ACAD has had consistent earning growth year after year and has been a bullish staple in portfolios for the past few years. Many still have their fair price set at $50 to $60 a share. RSI is under 30, this stock is heavily oversold right now. Acadia is a company with a good track record and has bou ced back from dips a number of times in It's history, just look at charts from 2008 and  2018  It's currently sitting at just under $24 which to me looks like a steal right now and I'm liking the stock.

354,"For those thinking of taking profits today, be smart about it","Alright we've gone past 200 now, currently at 220 at premarket. It makes sense why some people will be thinking to take profits. But if you are please be smart about it and maximise your returns while ensuring you hold on to maximise any potential squeeze.

There are many new people on this sub who are new to the market and need to hear this basic advice on how to play now they are seeing some green.

You need to set stop losses that rise with the increasing price to guarantee profit:

- Let's say your cost basis is 150
- You decide the current price is a nice profit for you (I don't believe it is the squeeze is still on, but for arguments sake let's run with it)
- You then decide to sell at 200, take your profits and run home.
- Be fucking smart about it.
- Instead
- You should let the price run and set your stops accordingly. 
- For example, the price is at 220 right now. You set a stop at 190 in case it tanks.
- But if it rises to 250 then set a stop at 220 in case it drops.
- If it rises to 300 set a stop at 250 etc etc
- This way you maximise your returns in case this keeps running higher and higher.

A fair word of caution though, you may be stopped out by algos. Or if this drops suddenly then rises again you will be stopped out.

Also you will kick yourself if you sell here if it rises to 1k and beyond.

But if it helps some of you paper hands hold then set larger stops. So 100 dollar increments or larger till we hit 1k.

Myself personally I am way in the green right now. I will set a stop at my cost basis and take the risk. That way if we see a sudden tank then I will get back my investment, but I won't be stopped out by 20 dollar drops. And will maximise the run

355,Proposed Investment That Could Change Lives,"I know you're used to hearing about fancy stonks, options, etc., but this post is meant to convince you to waste your money for the sole purpose of making a statement.

Recently it was reported that Melvin Capital CEO purchased a new Miami home in Sunny Isles Beach, Miami for $44 mil ([Fancy Home](https://www.glebklioner.com/blog/miami-real-estate/2020/12/10/sudcfe6epua69rwl8c6sfhbwg63sph)). Turns out there is an AirBNB nearby, overlooking the neighborhood but its expensive ($500 per night).

I propose we raise money to send DFV and his family on vacation to beautiful Sunny Isles Beach, Miami where he can casually stand on his balcony in a silk robe and toss $1 bills out over Gabe Plotkin's home. This vacation could allow DFV to casually run into Gabe Plotkin in a restaurant and buy him a drink. Maybe, see him on the beach and set up a long football throw that causes DFV to dive for the catch right in front of Gabe's wife catching her attention as the sun glimmers off of his diamond hands.

Degenerates were talking about a $10,000 investment for a week (AirBNB + Flights for DFV, Wife, and Kid), but it would be the perfect way to let DFV celebrate a life changing year. If this post gets 6969 up votes Ill create a fundraiser and contact DFV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m15adj/proposed_investment_that_could_change_lives/,1615292498.0,108,108,0

So as the percentage of us holding stocks increases and the other part decreases and if we all stand strong we control the whole stock soon. After we have all stocks we can charge whatever we want which is the point of this I know.  

The unseen upside no one else has thought of is we can vote all together in shareholder meetings and do whatever we want.

But I'm having a hard time seeing why I wouldn't sell long calls for something that I already own 100 shares of that are deep ITM if the premium alone buys my shares. At that point, sure I'm selling my shares at a 'loss', but the premium literally just front-end paid for my shares. Why would I not use this to flip a stock that I think is gonna trade sideways for a long while? I can literally do this a bunch of times on a position I'm about 400 shares deep in. Sell the covered calls, if they get exercised, Oh NO I made a profit.

I get that stocks only go up and if I had long term prospects for an investment, it would make sense to just hold em. But when the premium for Deep ITM calls is almost the cost I paid for them, and then the sale of shares on top of that would just be extra money, no? So upside potential is limited to Premium collected + Sale Price - Cost of shares. But it's...basically free money on something I don't want to hold forever.

380,Reminder - Roblox IPO Is Coming March 10," 

# The Roblox IPO Is Coming March 10. Here Are 2 Things Investors Should Know

## Roblox stock is well-positioned to grow over the next few years.

**Roblox** was supposed to go public in 2020. Then the explosive trading debuts of **Airbnb** and **Doordash** forced it to rethink those plans.

If Roblox had proceeded with its original IPO plan, it could have left serious money on the table, just like Airbnb and Doordash did. And since the main point of an IPO is to raise capital -- not help institutional investors make a quick buck -- there might be a better way to do it.

And there is.

## Going public via a direct listing

After postponing the IPO, Roblox raised $520 million from investors in a private funding round. The deal gave Roblox a $29.5 billion valuation -- [up sevenfold ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/1-chart-showing-robloxs-12x-valuation-increase/)from a year ago.

Next, Roblox announced its plan to go public via a direct listing. This [route](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/01/spacs-vs-direct-listings-key-differences-investors/) could further save Roblox money on underwriters' fees while still taking the company public.

Roblox will finally make its market debut on March 10, trading under the ticker RBLX. But before rushing in to buy the stock, here are two things you should know.

## Roblox's money-making machine

CEO David Baszucki and Erik Cassel founded Roblox in 2004 with a vision of connecting people through immersive virtual worlds. On Roblox, users create games and play games created by other users. Initially, Roblox had a user base of several hundred people. Today, more than 36 million users play and interact on Roblox on a daily basis.

There are two crucial parts to Roblox's business model. The first part is the gaming platform on which users (developers and gamers) build and play games. Here, 7 million developers are building what Roblox calls ""experiences"" -- games, virtual items, and worlds. Thanks to Roblox's tools, it is easy for even children to create exciting games using Lego-like blocks instead of code. 

With 18 million experiences available to choose from, Roblox can easily attract new users and retain old ones. And as more users join Roblox's platform (and spend money on those games), developers are incentivized to create more engaging content -- drawing in even more gamers.

But that's just half the story.

When users enter Roblox, they usually invite their friends to join them. Then those friends invite *their* friends, and so on. With endless experiences to choose from, this virtuous cycle sustains Roblox's network effect. Sound familiar? That's how [**Facebook** grew](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/07/28/proof-facebook-inc-has-a-moat.aspx) into what it is today. 

And because these games are not ""just"" games -- they are *Minecraft-*style worlds with plenty to discover -- Roblox's users spend lots of time on the platform. Even users who aren't gamers stick around just to hang out with each other. Like Facebook, Roblox is a social network.

Backed by the sheer size of its community, Roblox has managed to carve out an ecosystem with its own rules, economy, and currency. Users don't have to pay to play most games on Roblox. But they can buy and spend Robux -- Roblox's in-game currency -- to upgrade their avatars with accessories, clothing, or special powers.

To generate revenue, Roblox gets a 30% cut on user spending. The rest goes to developers on the platform. It also earns a commission when developers convert Robux into real dollars. So far, all this has worked out well for Roblox. Revenue grew 56% in 2019 to $488 million. In the first nine months of 2020, revenue grew even faster -- rising 68% to $589 million.

## Roblox is just getting started

COVID-19 was a turbocharger for Roblox, [just like](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/06/3-top-video-game-stocks-to-buy-in-october/) it was for many other video game companies. Roblox's daily active users [jumped 97%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/why-is-everyone-talking-about-the-roblox-ipo/) year over year in 2020 -- the fastest rate of growth ever. Many of Roblox's users are still new, but will likely become more engaged over time. As they discover great games to play and immerse themselves in Roblox's many communities, they will naturally spend more Robux.

Roblox is also targeting international markets to grow its user base further. It has invested in automated translation technology and a regional compliance system that will help developers reach a bigger global audience. It is also working with **Tencent Holdings** to grow its business in China, the world's biggest video game market.

Beyond gaming, Roblox's potential dramatically widens its addressable market. It aims to evolve into what it calls a ""human co-experience"" platform where people can come together to play, learn, and work. For example, Roblox could host virtual classes, alongside graduation ceremonies, corporate meetings, and concerts in the future. Moreover, as its social network grows, Roblox will become even more attractive as a marketing tool. In fact, major brands like **Netflix** and Marvel have already introduced branded content onto the platform. 

For Roblox, all these opportunities represent potential growth engines -- and a bright future. While it is unlikely that all of these ventures will end up being a runaway success, some will, and that will be enough to keep Roblox growing fast for many years ahead.

## It will be a volatile ride ahead

2020 was the year of the red-hot tech stock. Popular names like **Square** and **MercadoLibre** are trading at steep valuations after rising 240% and 180% last year. Newer tech IPOs like **Unity Software** and Airbnb have more than doubled from their offering price.

Roblox will likely get a similarly warm welcome, along with a high IPO valuation. That's understandable, given Roblox's track record of rapid growth -- as well as the potential to sustain it for many more years.

Still, that's no reason to leave caution to the wind. Investors should not overpay for a stock, no matter how great its prospects look. Also, Roblox is running at massive losses, and this may be the case for years ahead.

It's not unusual for [high-growth companies](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/types-of-stocks/growth-stocks/) to invest heavily to fuel market-beating growth. But a loss-making business *and* high valuations make any stock extremely vulnerable to a market correction. And given how [shaky tech](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/these-2-tech-giants-pulled-the-nasdaq-back-from-th/) stocks are these days, Roblox won't be in for a smooth ride.

389,A Non-Technical Bullish Thesis on AMD,"Hey All - Here are my main thoughts as to why I have such a overwhelming part of my portfolio in AMD.

Feel free to disagree, agree or critique. WSB seems mostly bullish on AMD but we don't need an echo chamber!

Bullish:
- Zen has been a hit and the road map into Zen 4 looks to keep kicking Intel while it's down.
- Recent offerings from the Radeon group have been increasingly more competitive, even rivaling Nvidia's core business on a fraction of Nvidia's R+D budget.
- Zen 3 continues to show excellence in incorporating Chiplet technology. Chiplet technology allows for greater yields at the foundary, product flexibility and lower costs.
- This experience should transfer to Chiplet GPU technology - allowing for the Radeon group to perhaps take a measurable lead on Nvidia for a generation or two while they catch up.
- Epyc Milan looks dynamite and AMD will be able to gain market share in the computer server market. Recent hires in this area will help AMD gain more adoption.
- New chiplet CNDA data center GPU's on the horizon.
- New software stack incoming to compete with Nvidia's DLSS. This upscaling is rumored to provide a 2x performance boost and will be integrated into each games engine. Adoption by game companies is almost guaranteed since both consoles use and are set up to use the same technology.
- Business world views Lisa Su and AMD as ""execution machines"" - Moore's Law is Dead video. Product roadmaps and goals have consistently met and goals beaten expectations.
- Extensive business relationships with Microsoft and Sony.
- Mass OEM adoption seems to be happening in both Laptop and Desktop market.
- Xilinx merger adds massive revenue and capabilities.
- Because Lisa Su.

Bearish:
- Capacity issues at TSMC have restricted profits at times.
- They are competing with 2 monster companies in Intel and Nvidia in their core business areas.
- Semiconductor stocks are volatile by nature.
- Post Pandemic conditions might reduce profit margins.

That being said I'm confident the Bullish thesis is much more powerful than the Bearish one.

Please feel free to reply with any other bullish or bearish arguments. The more we can discuss the better informed everyone is.

&#x200B;

So, yesterday an individual brought up an interesting discussion about who's driving this rocket we'll only call the Stock.  You see, I spend a lot of time looking at charts and figuring out if my damaged brain can comprehend certain patterns anymore.  I've noticed some epic battles taking place during the rise of the Stock, and I've been trying to document them for my own future research into the mysterious world of Wallstreet.  

So this morning I arose to the screeching of my neighbor's cock, and began my morning routine of staring at stocks and willing them to not continuing their downward progression into obscurity and my destitution.  Lo and behold, the Stock is flying like a lonely teenager to his treehouse with a new piece of erotica, and there are some interesting things happening in some of the boxes,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[We don't know who they are, but we'll call the green side Apes and the red side Hedgies for the sake of Storytime.](https://preview.redd.it/n0v3y3qmqzl61.png?width=230&format=png&auto=webp&s=11a03f23123b9bf68d45c293a9768cfb366e391f)

&#x200B;

I see an Ape and a Hedgie getting ready to throw down and fight.  I don't know if the Ape is one of the Apes from WSB, but they are holding the price above 220, so I like them for now.  That damn Hedgie is holding us under 221 though, so I don't like him.  I see a smaller Ape later, holding the Stock up again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Ape holds above 222](https://preview.redd.it/b8ifgnwsrzl61.png?width=223&format=png&auto=webp&s=37edfc6b33f0ed90e024337e4172a951959eb40b)

&#x200B;

I see this as a good thing, but I didn't know there was trouble brewing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[We see a large wall build at 235, and moments later there were large blocks sold between them that I saw while I cropped the screencap.](https://preview.redd.it/zdrd54edszl61.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcacc0a7d623b01c68d59953b60b5e2700581060)

There is a small skirmish between a Hedgie at 235 and an Ape holding at 226ish.  The Hedgie releases several blocks, bring the fight down to 218ish where an Ape saves the Stock from further plummet.  The battle is far from over, but I've decided that if I want to tell you this story I need to actually stop just taking screencaps and write it out.

If you're looking for a moral to this story, there isn't one, just that I found it interesting and there was a post yesterday that I was reminded of when I saw this trend.  I don't even know how to read, so don't expect this to have any bearing on anything ever in the entirety of creation.

417,The Fed’s dual mandates and what that means for markets (and how the potentially negative effects won’t matter any time soon),"What are the Fed’s dual mandates?

* Full employment

* Inflation control

What is inflation control?

* The reason markets always go up with time is the ever-perpetual growth nature of productivity; that’s how the pie doesn’t get diced up, but grows forever. But even across many decades the growth of productivity experiences ebbs and flows—which we’ll get into later.

* As technology and innovation caused increased productivity over the last 100 years, the Fed has developed many tools to control inflation if it runs too hot or cold. This began with using interest rates as a lever, with buying risky debt that bubbles up (QE) as a second lever. Modern Monetary Theory introduces a third lever: direct money to consumers to stimulate inflation, also known as helicopter drops. With the pandemic, we’ve seen a version of this already.

* The elephant in the room is that we’re around the end/beginning of a long-term credit cycle (read PRINCIPLES by Ray Dalio if you’re unfamiliar with the term). As a rough example, a long cycle can last 50-75 years and a short cycle 6-8 years. But what really matters is that monetary stimulus becomes less and less effective as more and more stimulus is used to pay debts that have grown throughout the multiple short credit cycles that make up a long credit cycle. The Fed bazooka was a bazooka for exactly this reason.

* Most importantly, price control involves both directions. Despite concerns of hyperinflation that we saw the last century, this is not the case today but exactly the opposite and is a feature of the end/beginning of a long credit cycle. Productivity and wages have slowed for over a decade, and the things we do spend money on—and don’t—have become cheaper or are now free digital services (except for health care and housing and others, which have more than filled that spending gap).

What is full employment, and why is it a part of the Fed mandate?

* Full employment is the point where there is some amount of labor shortage, causing companies to start competing for workers by offering higher wages. This creates inflation. Before the pandemic, the Fed considered the economy close to full employment and lower wage workers were starting to see a small amount of wage growth. 

What do the Fed’s dual mandates mean for markets?

* Because of the nature of where we are in the long term credit cycle, it means everything. And with the pandemic, the major monetary intervention that was due to come eventually happened earlier, and some would argue greater than without: lower rates for longer, QE indefinitely, and perhaps eventually a firmer version of MMT once the first two levers stop working enough to make much a difference in accomplishing their mandates. 

Why won’t the potential negative effects of the Fed’s dual mandates matter any time soon? 

* If it took a decade after the Great Recession for the economy to reach full employment and to finally see the hints of wage growth, the road to full employment could take more than a couple years—recent history has shown it could take another short term cycle. 

* The tug and pull pendulum between capital and labor has been swinging towards capital for decades, where most of the productivity gains are being realized by capital. This is politics, which is not a part of the Fed’s framework so we won’t go there, but it does put them in a hard place. This is good for markets considering the Fed’s dual mandates. Eventually the pendulum will swing the other way, but history has shown it likely won’t happen this cycle—and even if it does the politics will be slow and behind a backdrop of extremely accommodative monetary policy that will likely last the entirety of the current short credit cycle in some degree.

**TLDR: The biggest threat to markets is the Fed adjusting to full employment and the inflationary forces of rising wages—not a temporary inflationary bounce of the economy opening back up and the pent-up spending demand it will bring. History shows it will take at least a short credit cycle for that inflationary threat to be fully realized.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0zo3m/the_feds_dual_mandates_and_what_that_means_for/,1615267556.0,193,193,0

424,$BB Blackberry Breaking Out To The Upside,"Heads up, autists... the resurgence of Blackberry is beginning. $BB stock jumped over 20% from last Friday's low and broke through multi-month resistance. Why is it starting to run? the reason is that it’s a solid post-COVID recovery play.

The company’s recent movement comes largely from the announcement by the US President Joe Biden that electric vehicles (EV) – and other green energy initiatives – will see massive investment worth billions of dollars. Even better, President Biden stated he would be changing 650,000 federal vehicles into EVs. BlackBerry stock could rise as its QNX software remains at the forefront of autonomous vehicle use where security is a major issue.

Blackberry used to make phones that were hard-to-hack; they no longer do that. Now, they're a software company focused on integrating their impossible-to-hack QNX software platform into every element of the transportation industry: autonomous EV's, advanced driver assistance systems, platforms for automakers, smart city infrastructure, IoT logistics and cybersecurity for connected cars. This is a legit company with huge upside long-term.

I'd pay attention to 1) the chart action 2) evidence of increasing QNX adoption by automotive manufacturers 3) Low implied volatility on the options.

I’m long  Jan 2022 25c options. **I LIKE THE STONK**

Here on /r/wsb, there is a fair amount of bearish sentiment that retail will be bagholders on GME ultimately, but there seems to be a lot more enthusiasm on it. The trajectory of GME's ascent this time feels different from the previous time, little volume on most days, less volatility than before, a much lower interest rate on borrowing to short.

Apart from the possibility that a) the HFs have given up, or b) the shorts have already been squeezed (mostly) and retail is actually just bidding up the stock against themselves while thinking that the HFs are on the other side (fairly large daily volume makes that less likely, but you never know), what are some opinions on here about what the hedge-funds are up to? If they are still exposed to risk, they seem to be playing it differently this time. They have a lot of really smart people working for them, and a lot of capital, so even accepting that they are greedy and fallible, they must have a plan for how to try to extricate themselves from this situation with as little a loss as possible.

Edit: this is not financial advice


As you can see, most of things going on with GME right now are just MSM being paid to lure normies into selling their positions. For background, I work in one of the major finance companies, not on finance but with machine learning/time series prediction, but I've lots of meetings with lots of people, and people talk. I can't give away too much info because it may cost my job, but the deep shit going on is over the charts, in 100 years this event will be spoken of.


First of all, not all hedge funds shorted GME, this is important because of what is about to happen, some funds managers are actually selling the assholes of their wives and first born sons to banks to get loans, I'm speaking of exorbitant amounts, remember that 35% of the dollars ever printed were printed last year, guess who is going to get a big piece of that ? Why ? They want to be the bigger fish on the aquarium, WSB opened the door for few hedge funds to expand brutally by destroying others.


Maybe people here didn't realize yet what they started, but it has epic proportions and you are living it right now. Second, big hedge funds are partnering up, but this is where comes the problem, imagine that you will try to rob a bank, what make you sure that the people that you partner with won't kill you to have less people to share the money with ? This is the current situation, this is the waiting, hedge funds, including the company that I work with are waiting for the money, and to see who they can trust. In the end they will all backstab each other, this is the finance industry, you can't deny it. Because soon as the price skyrocket to alpha centauri, guess who will be greedy to start another fucked up short ? Yes, the hedge funds, all over again, but is far easier to short at 750$, so is just a matter of who will short first. At work lots of people are absurdly greedy regarding shorting it, that was what created this opportunity, but some people never learn.


This is why you should hold, I'm holding just for fun and to see this shit show, if one day I sell, I will get the dollar bills and put in a frame in my wall, we are living the WW III of financial markets, now we are on the ships awaiting to arrive to the beach on a new D day, meanwhile some hedge funds are on our side (long, but don't think that they care about you as a person) coming with the atomic bombs. One risk that we escalated at work is that paper hands (as you like to call them) may sell leaving the other funds not vulnerable to a massive attack, rendering all this useless. Hold if you can, this is a game of patience, soon the direction will change, fucking huge buy orders will come and they will artificially inflate the price while other funds will have to think fast on get bankrup sooner, or be bankrupt later.


Can't say much, but few funds already gave their CEOs and managers some quite fat bonuses, why ? This is the last song, last dance, they are looting the ship before it sinks. You have no reason to believe in me, I'm a random guy on the internet, but pay attention to the fucking events that are going on, and you will understand that this is much bigger than just making few bucks. If you put all of this together, you will see that the silence of operations (see the fucking low volume) means the silence before the storm. Wait to see the news of hedge fund managers hanging themselves

431,Wall Street Bets Kept me off Crack,"I know this sub is flooded with these types of posts lately, but I thought I'd share my story.

7 months ago to (to the day) I was at my lowest low.  I barely remember this period due to benzo and alcohol abuse, but I had been homeless for a few weeks at that point.  I had abused crack previously but when I lost access to my bank account I was doing anything cheap.

Although not officially divorced my wife had kicked me out (can't blame her) and I had almost nobody willing to pull me out of the spiral.  During this period my daughter (black) kept asking ""where's daddy?  I want to see daddy"", it absolutely breaks my heart to think of what she went through.

Anyways my wife had emptied our joint bank account and I couldn't handle sleeping on the street sober.  I got to a shelter, and after somewhat getting cleaned up I was able to rent out my friend's garage and stock shelves at the Safeway.  But I was getting fairly depressed and would occasionally enter spirals of substance abuse, it seemed like a full relapse was right around the corner.

When sober, I spent most of my afternoons in the library, where I learned about you retards.  And once I remembered my IRA was still well stocked, I immediately began taking advice from some of you.  I couldn't believe it, the rush from day trading felt EXACTLY LIKE CRACK.  And the money I made was FAR more than a days work at safeway.

I was all in GME at 73, and can't convey to you how it felt to know I was going to be rich.  We're all going to be rich.  Thank all of you autists so much for helping me and helping each other!

449,My thoughts going into FOMC next week | Long Duration : $QQQ $GLD $TLT $FXI," 

# What is priced in FED Land ? 

Nearly a full hike in EOY 22 | 2.3 % Average fed funds over next 30 years | 10/2 at 143 bps which is a level last seen in Dec 2016 which is the peak of the Trump era.  
I Believe in light of recent fed communication that this is too aggressive. Fed communication has made it clear that what matters is u6 ^((the real unemployment figure)) and that their tolerance of the constraint is a “sustained overshoot of 50bps - Bullard or ""even 3% wouldn’t worry me as long as it’s not 3% on the way quickly to 4% - Evans   
For those who have offered concrete formulation of what the AIT, it is clear that what will be the rate hiking cause is NOT inflation but the path to max employment as, by all accounts and consensus, we will NOT reach such a high inflation path over a year. **Thus any Employment data surprise will be hawkish and vice versa Now that we have defined the optimization problem which the FED is solving**, let’s try to solve it using the data and see if we agree with the market:   


**CapEcon - (Does not take into account infra bill)**  
 We anticipate QE will be tapered from the start of 2022, and a very gradual rate liftoff will begin in mid-2023. We expect base-effects and fiscally stimulated growth will allow inflation to reach levels rarely experienced over the past decade, with headline inflation flirting with 3% and core inflation around 2.4%, Uncontrolled overheating isn’t likely if inflation expectations remain anchored. JPM forecast anticipates this move, but frames it as transitory volatility rather than trend. So should the Fed. Given that money markets are pricing an early Fed liftoff but TIPS markets are not pricing an inflation overshoot, either investors doubt the Fed or don’t understand it Markets likely to struggle to price in an even earlier Fed hike. Take profit on tactical longs in 5Y UST and stay neutral duration

**Barclays**   
Despite the sharp sell-off, long -term yields do not look high in the context of a stronger growth outlook. Still, front-end yields are inconsistent with the FAIT framework. We maintain our recommendation to be long 3y US Treasuries. Given the steepening, we are turning neutral on our front to intermediate steepener view. While it seems premature to declare that the hiking cycle (the start of which is two years away) would be finished within five years, with more stimulus likely down the road, there is some risk of an overshoot as well. Also, as we argued here, passage of an infrastructure plan later this year could still push long-term real yields higher. At the upcoming FOMC meeting, the Fed is likely to convey a greater tolerance for above-target inflation before raising short-rates than is priced in. This should push out the timing of the start of the hiking cycle, in our view. We view the rise in long-term yields as reflecting a brighter economic outlook. Progress on infrastructure spending poses upside risks to them.

**YELLEN**   
It would take 2 years at this rate to get back to pre covid u6 (puts us on March 23)

**GS** WITH INFRA /!\\   
the simulation implies 7% Q4/Q4 GDP growth in 2021, a decline in the unemployment rate to 3.7% in 2021Q4 and 3% by 2023Q4, a pickup in core inflation to 2.2% by 2023, and one to two rate hikes in 2023 under our interpretation of the Fed’s new framework. We expect FOMC participants to be more conservative in their projections at this early stage of the recovery, with a median forecast of 2.1% inflation and one rate hike in 2023. Our own forecast instead calls for liftoff somewhat later, in the first half of 2024, because our inflation forecast is a bit lower, reflecting a lesson from last cycle that an extremely tight labor market will likely be needed to generate the level of inflation that the FOMC now requires for liftoff.

**MS**   
While inflation in the reopening-sensitive sectors is likely to prove transient,a more sustainable impulse to inflation will start to take shape in 2021 – led by shelter inflation,healthcare services,and a multi-quarter passthrough of dollar weakness into goods. The sustainable inflation impulse intensifies in 2022as cyclically sensitive inflation components start to dominate – based on a tightening labor market and robust levels of demand. Core PCE to peak at 2.3 on DEC 22 !!!!*that TIPS-based breakeven inflation, based on CPI inflation measures, could move considerably higher and still be consistent with a PCE inflation outcome modestly above the 2% target.”*

**My own Conclusion** If you assume no infra or an infra bill that is close to entirely paid for via additional taxes and has a low multiplier we are definitely slightly above fair value in terms of rates. The Fed into FOMC next week WILL not assume an infra bill or its implications within the SEP thus in this case it is still possible to have a SEP that shows **no HIKE in 2023** So I cannot help but be bullish duration (& implications, see title) into FOMC March 16 and Auctions March 11 However - **Progress on infra / Data points indicating or suggesting faster path to min u6 will be hawkish EuroDollars (& implications)**   
I DO Believe there will be progress on an infra bill that will be generally expansionary in the end - thus the real trend is still an increase in real rates / ED and the implications that come with it : \* Gold down / \* TXN down / \* Dollar up vs EUR,CHF,Yen / \*NQ valuation down / \*Banks up / \*Value > Growth / But there should be a respite as we’ve already had strong progress in this direction and   
a) we will get a FED that, by ignoring the infra bill, will be able to push back VERY strongly through the SEP   
b) We are hearing stories of Manchin refusing to use fillibuster (which would make the infra bill A LOT Less exciting)   
How to trade this then ? Clearly, the real solution is to sell puts on NQ expiring soon to buy puts expiring later (apply that to all the other asset classes)

I've updated the gamma squeeze calculator to include all the option chains until 2023 and removed the 3/5 expired ones, it now contains a total of 2,603 strikes and expiries. I have also added several new parameters to address shortcomings that others had pointed out. If for example you wish to only include strikes that will expire ITM in that week, now you can do it via the filters.

The calculator can be used to simulate several projected delta hedging scenarios under different forecasted prices with the time value as a parameter

We see from the cover that even using very conservative parameters, MMs are holding close to 20% of the float just to delta hedge, which might partly explain the high float percentage owned by institutions as displayed on Bloomberg's terminal.

Now 🦍 🦍 🦍 only have limited amount of 🍌🍌🍌, 🦍 🦍 🦍 need to ensure each 🍌 is used for maximum effect. Based on the calculator's BSM modeling, the best delta/price ratio in the options chain across all expiries would be

The 3/12 270C, if apes were to buy one contract, 3.04 x 100 = $304, then MMs would need to hedge 0.137x100x137.74 = $1882 worth of shares to remain delta neutral

Giving an amplification factor of

**1 🍌 -> 6 🍌**

OTM calls like these might be fine for YOLO-ers 🦍 , but carry very high risk of 🦍 loosing all 🍌, if 3/12 closing price ends below 270. A safer way for 🦍, would probably be ITM calls, somewhere around the 100-110C strike price

This would still gives 1 🍌 -> 3 🍌 in delta hedge amplification

The profit / loss for 🦍🦍🦍 would be

Suppose $GME on 3/12 does close above 151, what should 🦍 do next ? Best would be to exercise those calls, but most 🦍🦍🦍 are poor(because they are 🦍🦍🦍) and don't have enough powder to exercise calls. The next best thing would be to rollover those calls, selling 🦍's calls that are expiring and buying the next week's ITM calls at higher strike, further propagating the gamma squeeze. Here's a graphical illustration of the process

this way, 🦍 ape can ensure 🍌 is used to maximum effect, without taking on too much risk while also mitigating the shorts attacks.

🦍🦍🦍 path to victory is almost ensured, but 🦍 should be aware that  🦍 is not in the final stage yet, 🦍 still needs to go through MMs first before showdown with 🐊👑 in WallStreet.

**Edit 1 :**

**The 3/8 closing price of 194.5 should've triggered an additional 3 million stocks of delta covering, bringing the total stocks bought by MM for delta hedging to 13.5 million(25% of float)**

**Edit 2:**

**Buying the strike/expiry mentioned in this DD at open today would've netted you EOD**

**3/12 270C +340%**

455,"This Missionary of $GME has Converted the Family, next the neighborhood?"," Many weeks ago, an Angel appeared before me.

With  flowing locks of gold and eyes shaded to prevent my soul from being  destroyed by gazing upon their magnificence, he shook the sky as he  spoke in the tone of a disappointed Father, 'Gamestop will connect the  world to the virtual marketplace for not just the tangible, BUT the  Intangibles! Who else hires employees that actually care about the  product they are selling and want to see you enjoy yourself with the  coolest new games and classic oldies? And yet you do not buy this  supremely attractively priced stock?""

Then,  He showed me roads of diamonds filled with the Biggest, Fattest retards  I have ever seen driving lambos, bringing back the 'High-Five' (to show  off your DiamondHands), and a kitten that looked like Nick Naylor  swimming in money. ""These are the fruits, and the bounty for those who  listen to my words.""

And then, I  was taken to an island floating in fields of fire and around me ---  heads on stakes (including an ironically named Vlad), melting Bentleys,  hedgies being deep fried into tendies. ""Here is the faith of those that  seek to destroy American Companies to make billions. A sea of fire in  the morning and acting out my favorite Harvey Weinstein Scenes with  Harvey in the afternoons. The Meek Shall Inherit!""

Finally,  as he vanished into the heavens on the Biggest Rocket that I have ever  seen he called out, ""Do not forget, a man named Jonah and the fact that  you live near a river, if you disregard my commands!""

After this, I bought $GME.

""Weeks  of pay into a dumb strip mall store!"" my family said as they laughed at  me.  ""What a foolish, stupid thing to do! You are going to go broke.""  my parents said. ""Please don't lose our money on wars the people can't  win!"" said the wife. My friends said I was going crazy from being inside  so much. ""Go Build an Ark next they said!""

But now. They have become quiet.  The great flood has begun!

All will attempt to climb onto the GME Ark, but will never be able to hold on with their PaperHands as $GME goes to $1000!

460,GME Adjusted Future Value as compared to Amazon's online Electronics' sales.,"Hey Guys, 

I went full retard and thought to myself, hey GME plans to become Amazon of electronics right? So why don't we compare these two when it comes to market caps and their share values.

I might have went full autistic and I used Amazon's Market cap and online electronics' sales as values that are correlated.

MKT CAP: 1.54 T, 

Total Rev: 125.56 B

55.1% Of revenue is Electronics = 69.18 B

Amazon's share value is rounded to $3000, # of shares is 503,000,000

GME $250, # of shares 69,750,000

Assumptions:

GME will steal - 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100% of that business. This is ignoring all of the other things that either of the businesses have going on for them.

55.1% of 1.54T = $848.54B (Market cap value)

25% = $212.135B (Market cap value)

50% = $424.27B (Market cap value)

75% = $636.405B (Market cap value)

90% = $736.686B (Market cap value)

100% = $848.54B (Market cap value)

Add current GME's Market cap of 15.53 B to each.

Adjusted GME Share value when they steal amazon's % of electronic revenue with those Market Cap Values:

25% = $3,264.01 per share

50% = $6,305.38 per share

75% = $9,346.74 per share

90% = $11,171.56 per share

100% = $12,388.10 per share

SO WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU SELL FOR LESS? THESE ARE NOT EVEN SQUEEZE VALUES. I'M JACKED TO THE TITS, A BIT RETARDED, AND HOLDING FOR MY LIFE. 

GODSPEED.

467,Possible last ditch play scenario from hedgie on $AMC with earnings report," 

Everything just came together in a glorious trainwreck in my retarded ape brain.

Ive been seeing these bots on Webull holding up these sell walls starting .02 cents above market value and moving up a penny at a time to about .08 cents above market. So These orders move and stay in the same position above market value no matter what the price or how fast it moves. I have seen that every so often one of these sells go through. FUCKING LAG!

So if im right about this, this means Hedgie is accumulating shares here and there. I have seen this in other markets im able to watch closely although webull is where im watching the most since its where im trading.

I have also seen some extremely large buy orders go through that my gut tells me are Hedgie buys. 10-20k shares at a time.

So what I am getting at here is that Ive seen things all over the market that suggest to me that Hedgie short seller is actually buying shares right now, but its not enough to come close to covering their shorts. So what would Hedgie want to do with these stacks of shares?

Well earnings report are tomorrow. Now I dont know what time the info is going to be released. But what I expect is Hedgie is going to let the market go at open tomorrow, and where ever we move the price we move the price. So that their is hype, then when earnings come out they are going to dump as hard as they can and drop that price with a dive that looks like a crash. First off it wont crash, If they had they selling power to crash it they would crash it to cover their shorts right? But its going to dip very hard and fast. The 1m chart is going to shake every paper handed retard around. and cause a further dip.

IF THIS GOES DOWN LIKE THIS (because this is just a thought)

BUT IF IT GOES DOWN LIKE THIS LISTEN UP!

This will be the moment of truth. YOU MUST REMAIN RESLIENT If #DiamondsHands is just a hash tag to you, you will probably be out when this happens and probably at a loss too. ITS NOT A LOSS IF YOU HOLD. Our best move if this goes down, is to double down and #BuyTheDip like you have never bought the fucking dip before. My gut is telling me 7.50ish low, possible 6.50 depending on how many paper hands been front like diamond hands.

If you get shook at this point this was all for naught. This will be a last ditch effort for them to win this war. If you sell you could drop the price low enough for hedgie to start buying back short positions. That would be disastrous. YOU CANNOT FUCKING SELL HERE. If this is going to shake you please get out before the announcement, take your profits and run. Its 11.60 as I write this. Take a sweet profit and let us hold those shares for you.

Again if this goes down. REAL investors are going to see AMC's earnings and if the loss isnt terrible it will attract organic investors getting ready to make some money off this squeeze and long term off reopenings. So long as earnings are at less of a loss than Q2 & Q3 We will be good. This is expected. The real activity that will come behind the announcements will boost the price up. This whole thing could play out in 30 min to an hour, or over the course of a few hours.

Real Diamond Hands players will understand this, real investors are going to see through this bullshit, THIS IS MEANT TO SHAKE YOU, yeah you reading this and those apes who dont. Our only play to beat this is to hold that shit like youve never held before. You are on the outside of the rocket hanging on to handle bars breaking the atmosphere at this point, what you are feeling is the last bit of resistance. Secondary play is to when this dip happens to buy as much as you fucking can, this our chance to make our position infinitely stronger by doubling down on their last ditch effort.

I have planed to set a buy for 100 more shares in the 7.60 cent range.

If im right im right, if im wrong i dont need more shares than I already have to change my life in the short squeeze. But the take away is dont get shook if this scenario plays out or anything similar.

One thing im certain of is you can expect negative press about the earnings no matter what they actually are. and you can expect the bot swarm to push that negative press all over the place. be ready to combat this and educate people about why amc is not going to report a profit.

Anyway If you stuck through my retarded ramblings I hope this helps you better prepare for a possible negative price reaction to the earnings report. THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, just the ramblings of a retarded coin investor who got attracted to this whole thing smelling hedgie blood in the water like a shark. I just wanted to drink their tears and laugh never expected to make money. Now that this is playing out I see we have a potential here like there has never been before. If you did find my retarded ramblings insightful you can catch more retarded market analysis on twitter @ [Crypt0\_Killa](https://twitter.com/Crypt0_Killa)

468,"TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) are considered dogshit, but are they?","I’ve been agonizing recently over how best to hedge against the coming hyperinflation and I can’t seem to find any good options that aren’t already mooning. Every source I can find seems to mention TIPS and then hand wave them as being trash. 

The argument against TIPS seems to be that the inflation they hedge against is already priced in. However, one thing that I believe is not being taken into account is the metric for inflation. TIPS calculates inflation based on the CPI-U. **The U in CPI-U stands for Urban**. This index is based on the price of goods and services in metropolitan areas. City centers have been disproportionately affected by Covid and this adds additional temporary deflationary pressures. The rest of the country also has Covid holding down inflation on goods and services, but to a lesser degree. 

I would argue that the current projected inflation for TIPS does not account for inflation on goods and services that has yet to come. As long Covid is keeping people inside, the massive amount of money we’ve just printed is being funneled into assets because it has nowhere else to go. Eventually it will make its way to goods and services, causing inflation much higher than is currently priced in. 

Am I missing something here? Do TIPS have other major drawbacks besides the “it’s priced in bro”?

TLDR: Covid has delayed inflation hitting goods and services, instead flowing into assets. The metric the government uses to calculate inflation for TIPS is based on urban centers that are extra-affected by Covid. The type of inflation TIPS recognizes will soon come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1dfdz/tips_treasury_inflationprotected_securities_are/,1615316239.0,10,10,0

470,Another wsb changed my life story,"A year ago tonight, my best friend was murdered. Shit sucked. Still does. Fucked up my whole life. The day of the funeral I lost my job to covid. Luckily I work at a good restaurant and they brought me back. I honestly kinda wish they hadn’t, as it’s been so stressful dealing with all the new rules and keeping people safe. Basically everything that could go wrong has gone wrong this year. You know the story, you probably lived it this year. But all of that changed in November when I saw the short squeeze post. 

It wasn’t immediate, but suddenly I had something to think about other than how awful life has been. I bought and sold and bought and sold and managed to lose like $60 on 40 shares over a few months and was done with GME. Then my belief was reaffirmed when it started climbing again. And I bought back in. Best decision of my life. 

I finally had a reason to wake up again. First it was just because it was a lifetime chance to make some cash, but it quickly grew into something indescribable. Everyone was talking about it, at work, at the store, my brother, literally everyone was talking about it. But they didn’t get. You all did. We all knew what was coming. We watched the storm building and raised our sails, trusting that if enough fucking retards did it too the wind would be manageable and we could sail to Valhalla, leaving the dock Wall Street aflame. 

I guess it comes full circle again today. The squeeze popped off again on a day that could’ve left me crippled but it’s pulled my out. I know that it’s all coincidence, but damn if it doesn’t feel good. You all have changed my life and made me believe in something again. 

I know this is way too long for you smooth brains, but thank you for being so damn stupid that this worked.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0mlq1/another_wsb_changed_my_life_story/,1615228782.0,974,974,0

472,The most Retarded and Big Brained play,"TLDR: Short calls as GME and AMC burn back into the atmosphere.

Yup you read that correctly. The most single retarded  play I have ever thought of, and I found it by accident.

Today trying to buy a single call at 9.5/March 19 I accidentally sold 2 calls I never had. Right at market open when the prices for calls for AMC going down. Took a minute to figure out my error and what happened. I was looking at my calls and they said they were negative, as in -2 calls. At which point I panicked and corrected my mistake and bought those 2 calls back and made a profit of $8-10

So what would happen if you sold a bunch of calls just at, and after the peak of GME or AMC. Well the money is credited to your account. Then you wait and hope your timing and judgement is correct and when the price is low enough buy back those calls. Yeah... keep thinking about that. 

So what would happen if you chose a date a few weeks after the squeeze and just waited to buy back. Theoretically you could make a %80-95 profit. 

The next question is what if you wait till the call just.... expires. Well then it is worth zero, how would you buy back zero? This is the question I have no idea if there are any rules or regulations for.

Sure you could invest in airline ETF like JETS but, air lines are luxury companies, and don't profit much.

484,Ride the NIO to the moon up more than 10% already,"HONG KONG/BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S.-listed Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers Li Auto Inc LI.O, Nio Inc NIO.N and Xpeng Inc XPEV.N plan to list in Hong Kong as soon as this year, tapping a growing investor base closer to home, said people with direct knowledge of the matter.

The trio each aim to sell at least 5% of enlarged share capital in the Asian hub, the people said. Based on their New York market capitalisation on Monday, proceeds could reach $5 billion.

The companies have been working with advisors on the sales which could begin as early as mid-year, said one of the people, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.

Li Auto, Nio and Xpeng - which have raised $14.7 billion in U.S. markets since 2018 - declined to comment. U.S.-listed shares of the three automakers rose between 3.7% and 5.3% in early deals.

The plans come as the trio increase capital raising efforts to fund technology development and expand sales networks, to better compete in the world's biggest EV market where U.S. peer Tesla Inc TSLA.O is boosting sales of its China-made vehicles.

This year is set to be crucial for EV makers to seize market share as the industry expects China sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) to jump almost 40% from last year to 1.8 million units.

""Despite much richer financial resources now compared with a year ago, EV start-ups still need to invest heavily in next-generation technology,"" said analyst Shi Ji at Haitong International. ""Exploring a secondary listing much closer to their home market, if any, is a good move.""

Selling shares in Hong Kong would also add the trio to a slew of New York-listed Chinese firms seeking a presence on more local exchanges amid Sino-U.S. political tension.

The rising number of such listings ""has enhanced the status of Hong Kong's capital markets globally, and also helped issuers reach higher valuations and raise more capital,"" said Zhang Zihua, chief investment officer at Beijing Yunyi Asset.



TRACK RECORD

Under Hong Kong rules, a secondary listing requires at least two financial years of good regulatory compliance on another qualifying exchange.

Li Auto and Xpeng went public in the United States mid-last year so will likely apply in Hong Kong for a dual primary listing, said three people with direct knowledge of the matter.

As per Hong Kong's dual primary listing rules, firms are subject to full bourse requirements in Hong Kong and a second exchange, but are not bound by the two-year condition.

Xpeng is also considering a third listing on Shanghai's STAR Market for new-economy firms, said two other people.

""In the long run, it's helpful for consumer-focused companies like us to connect with domestic capital markets and domestic investors,"" Xpeng President Brian Gu told Reuters last week, declining to comment on any Hong Kong listing plan.

""This is the direction we should pay attention to.""



GOING GREEN

China's government has heavily promoted NEVs - such as battery-powered, plug-in petrol-electric hybrid and hydrogen fuel cell cars - in response to chronic air pollution, spurring interest from technology companies and investors alike.

Last month, Reuters reported telecommunications firm Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL plans to market EVs as early as this year. nL1N2KW0HV

China forecasts NEVs will make up 20% of its annual auto sales by 2025 from around 5% in 2020.

Domestic vehicle deliveries last year totalled 32,624 by Li Auto, 43,728 by Nio and 27,041 by Xpeng. That compared with 147,445 vehicles by Tesla, industry data showed.

485,"Academy Sports and Outdoors, more than a Short Squeeze Opportunity","

Academy Sports and Outdoors (Ticker : ASO) isn’t just the next Rocket or Gamestop. You shouldn’t view them as simply a squeeze opportunity. If you’re looking for just a squeeze and quick 100% gains without ever thinking about the stock again, this isn’t the post for you, it holds lots of info but I’m not spamming rocket emojis and this isn’t a P&amp;D scheme. 

Academy Sports and Outdoors is a retailer of sporting goods based out of Katy, Texas which is just to the west of Houston. They’ve been mostly concentrated in the Houston area, but recently have been expanding into areas throughout the Southern US. During their expansion their careful selection of store locations “has been that it has never had to close one of its new stores, all of which have been profitable since their first day of operation. “ (From Wikipedia). They’ve been in the business for over 50 years now and looking to grow under new owners Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. 

As a proud Texan and frequent customer of Academy, I can say that Academy has a huge advantage in the Houston area. Their outdoor competition consists of Recreational Equipment Incorporated (Smaller and most expensive) , Bass Pro Shops (Bigger selection, but less locations) , and Gander Mountain (Closed 100 stores after bankruptcy) While on the Sporting Goods side they compete with Sports Authority (bankrupt) and Dick’s Sporting Goods (only in malls). They have a good grip on the Houston area and are continuing expansion. 

I’m not going to do a deep dive into financials but I’ll focus on the three major points about the company. Debt, EPS Growth, and ROE. The company has been able to smash earnings throughout the Pandemic and their YoY growths have been incredible to say the least. However, to get this kind of growth, they had to take on debt to subsidize their growth. The shorts are betting that this is the downfall of the company but they aren’t thinking about the long-term effects of taking on this debt. They’re using it for considerable expansion in a time where everyone else is shutting down their stores to cut costs and Academy is taking it as their huge opportunity to expand. They have been able to successfully cut down on debt through the issuance of Senior Notes and Secondary Stock Offerings
just recently so they are making all the right moves to make sure the debt isn’t holding them back. The third and final point is their 24% ROE, I shouldn’t have to explain what this means other than you should be excited about their incredible margins.

In the future, we may see their expansion slow slightly because real estate costs will rise inevitably as the country reopens but they were able to successfully take advantage of this opportunity thanks to the nifty work of Ken Hicks and the rest of the board. While new properties will rise in value I think they will still have good growth. The Reopening means more business though as people return to their brick and mortar locations and even more in-store pickup rather than people ordering items from Amazon or EBay. They believe that the hobbies that people picked up will continue to drive sales (I can attest, Frisbee Golf is basically a subscription service to new disks considering how bad I am) and of course the main thing people mention on here is their firearms. I can’t see what’s a better retail recipe right now than Guns, in Texas, during national unrest, while the government is giving people more money to buy guns and ammo. 

Not that I’m a huge fan of national unrest, but Academy’s widespread gun sales and healthy variety are great for sales. Some stores have 4 whole aisles filled up with all the .38, 12 gauge, and .44 ammo anyone could ever need while other stores feature only 3 aisles because they need more aisles for fishing equipment in the summer. While unrest maybe a problem on a national level, Academy stands to profit hugely being one of the largest firearms retailers in the American South. Also, since Spring is upon us they will see upticks in sales for camping and fishing equipment as well as general sports sales. 

These factors are contributing to interest in the stock from both the shorts and retail investors alike. Today’s bullish nod from Barron’s with a $30 price target and rising momentum on this subreddit will make ASO a stock to watch in the upcoming weeks. I’m not trying to recommend that you buy the stock, but I’m giving you information to give you a different look at Academy as more than a simple short squeeze opportunity. Before buying the stock yourself, do more DD  to get a better feel for the company and consider the risks that investing contains. Best of luck to y’all in your endeavor for big tendies.

TLDR: Gun sales are rising and Academy is a major retailer. Have a huge advantage over competition in Texas and they have expanded throughout the pandemic. Excellent EPS growth, top-tier Return on Equity, and the debt situation is being remedied. Bullish nod from Barron’s and momentum on WSB is setting up a huge breakout.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0xfvs/academy_sports_and_outdoors_more_than_a_short/,1615259709.0,149,149,0

496,Literally FREE MONEY! Applied mathematics to build an indestructible portfolio," 

I have been doing this for 1 month now and I'm 2k up, I really think this is the new way to build your portfolio with stocks.

It all started when I was thinking about my trading history, every fucking time I got wrecked. If I close a buy order, the stock usually goes down, the same way for a sell order, when I sell usually goes up. So I was thinking very hard on this, how could this binary outcome be so hard to achieve? Well, I invented a new way to build your portfolio so you will be 100% safe, I call it the B.R.T (Bait Retard Trades).

BRT - How does it work?

You will not do trading any different, you will continue to do your stupid trades, but this time you will use only up to 30% of your portfolio on your own trading ideas, and the other 70% you will use to perform the exact opposite. Warning! This will only work if you are honest with yourself, you should really think about what you think is best to use with your 30%, don't cheat and think the opposite just to use that on the 70%, you must trust the fact that you are actually retarded and don't know what you are doing, therefore the opposite position of your genuine choice will be the best. For example, last week I was thinking about getting some calls on PLTR that expires in a week, for many reasons I thought this was the best decision, so I did 30% of calls on PLTR and 70% on puts, made some money on the fact that I don't know what I'm doing. Being retarded gives you a superpower, you ALWAYS have the answer, it's just not what you think it is, it's the exact opposite.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m082y7/literally_free_money_applied_mathematics_to_build/,1615178874.0,12558,12558,0

509,Moon Gang," Yo ,

Sup bros.

I say bros because that's what you guys are to me. My brothers in the trenches.

I bought 20 shares of GME on Wednesday Jan. 27th.

I read the DD.

I threw money I could afford to lose and then I got played.

We all got played. Vlad and Citadel fucked us.

We might never get to the end of that story, but we all know that we got greased up and used like some fuck toy. Some more than others. (You're still on RH? wtf are you doing you're actually retarded)

Now its been a minute since that fateful day in January. We have been tested and tried by our friends, our family, the media but we held strong. We sat through WEEKS of 40$ lows. Waiting. Patiently. A flicker of hope still shone in the dark. You think we're selling now you greedy fucks?

Some of us drank piss.

Some of us got divorced.

But we all held.

We held each other like Jack held Rose while the mother fucking titanic sank to the bottom of the god damn ocean. Today was just the tip of that glorious penis shaped iceberg that took the whole ship down.

And we're not fucking letting go.

I'm not only here for my tendies.

I'm here for my brothers tendies.

I'm here for my wife's boyfriends tendies.

I'm here for every Rolex watch on every Citadel execs. wrist.

I'm here to suck Wall Street fucking dry and rub their nose in the god damn shit stained swamp that they call the financial system.

And as the system burns to the fucking ground, I'll be blasting god damn sea shanties in my Lambo.

At this point telling you guys to hold is literally useless. You guys know what the fuck to do because you've been doing it so long your hands have turned to diamonds.

To all my brothers,

See you on the moon.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K regardless. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

530,My love letter to the retards.,"I am almost certain that this will get lost in new, in amongst the sea of DD and gain porn that will inevitably be posted this evening, and I guess that is ok...

I just wanted to thank you all from the bottom of my hearts. I had been following this sub for a few months before it got all of its recent traction and I am not afraid to say that GME was the first time I was ever bold enough to invest. Now being the retarded ape that I am I somehow managed to invest at 240 (on the major come down), and subsequently managed to drag my a average price per share down to 179. 

This was over a month ago, and I had to endure the horrendous weeks of everyone telling me how fucking stupid I was for wasting the small amount of money I had on this stupid stock. While I was prepared to lose the money I had invested, I won’t lie, being down 83% felt pretty shit.

Well today, it turned around. For the first time since buying the stock I have closed the day in the green. You guys stuck with it through all of the shit and humiliation and finally we are seeing the rewards we deserve. 

This army of apes might just be the greatest thing Reddit has ever produced and I could not be prouder to be holding my 7 damn shares.

Seems like this is may be from momentum traders entering, but I'm not really sure why. I do know that when momentum flips on a news catalyst, these kind of stocks can drop fast and hard.

Lo and behold, the DISCA CEO just offloaded a HUGE $30 MM position last friday (March 4th):

I made a pretty penny shorting MRNA after the CEO sold an unusually large amount last year. It took about two days for the market to gain awareness of the sale (the SEC public disclosure forms take a lot of time to sort through and evaluate), then the stock dropped like a rock.

[The Hive Mind Trader - Theory](https://preview.redd.it/h0sal7sy2xl61.jpg?width=256&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d7033601ffa63fc64c10ad7f85df32b78ad1cc3)

I have decided to post elements of my work that have led me to produce proven theories with a very high probability of success. Such as being able to preemptively determine when GME will go parabolic. This is not me stating, this has been witnessed and utilized by others with a determining factor of success. To include the study of unique behavior patterns of individual stocks and industry. The thing about data is it is no good unless someone else can learn it and benefit from it.

&#x200B;

With that said, I am posting the crude work. At some point, I will clean it all up so it can be prettier and even have a flow sheet of sorts, but right now, I want to keep the focus on the depth of work and get feedback from others of like mind.

&#x200B;

I truly believe that this community of new traders has good intentions with their money. The ability to ascertain data that is truly helpful is scarce. We can seek out the most mentioned post or the percentage change of posts. However, that kind of data, albeit helpful, ends once the person clicks through. My goal is to treat my data like open-source code. If a person could take what I have produced and make it better, then the purpose has been served.

&#x200B;

This theory provides you explicit data outcomes that will provide you with what stock to select based on industry, 5 selected companies that share the same industry, the volume, price. As detailed in theory within, the data can be easily replaced to produce a different response as long as you follow the theory's criteria.

&#x200B;

At the core, this theory has derivatives of Newton's First Law of Motion:

*An object either remains at rest or continues to move at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force. (i.e., Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest.)*

**EDIT 1**: I did forewarn it was crude, so I apologize about the chicken scratches. I am trying to perfect the theory. This is the very long-winded structure to the basis of my various theories. I can't go around and say,  **I can predict a GME parabolic event** with no basis in which to define it.

There is no TL;DR with this one. This is theory data and within is the algorithm in which to test it. I mean, if you could 10x your portfolio by piecing this theory together, your time would be well spent.

EDIT 2: Fixed a word that someone asked so nicely to fix. 

Edit 3: I will transfer all data from the images to a google doc. I don’t my chicken scratches to hinder interest or collaboration.

549,An Investigative Report on Why Robinhood's Option Order Routing is Trash.,"TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM FOR THE RETARDS WHO CAN'T READ.

&#x200B;

Alright buckle up retards today we're going to answer a question that has managed to elude retards and algorithmic options traders who use Robinhood to exploit their free option trades for years.

Why the fuck is option order routing so bad? It always seems like I'm the last order to fill.

Well let me answer your question with another question What happens after you submit an order on Robinhood?

That we do know the answer to, and we shall go through it very quickly. Robinhood has their own order router, this does all the ""paperwork"" a trade needs for it to be able to be processed by a Market Maker, or by the execution venue.

So firstly, your order is sent to the RH order router, this first checks basic stuff, dividend risk, collateral req. checks, avail; funds checks, margin checks, and a PCO(position closing only) check. If any of that returns a false argument, the order is kicked back. If that's all good, the order is flashed onto the PFOF desk at Citadel Securities, they pay top dollar for the sweet, sweet dumb money pfof, that they will always adjust their books so that RH's order router routes to them first. Now Citadel has a set time to do with this order(because the exchanged price is still changing and of course its not public which is fucking fair right?). They can one: if the limit order on the marketbale option order is theo(theoretical price) + edge(which is hidden information due to game theory reasons), then the MM will fill you.

This can and does lead to something called price improvement. For example if the 69c for $ASS is trading at a spread of 0.69-0.86, with a theo of 0.74, the MM takes a 0.04 edge on the position, so any order above 0.78 will fill, which is technically better than paying 0.86 at the ask.

The problem with this however, is the rights to your order. Customer orders are supposed to have priority over MM orders on marketable option and equity tickers, BUT, MMs and Citadel rather take your order ""hostage"" with their own order placed on your behalf with flags set on the trade that a retail customer cannot set on their order.

I've been trading GOOGL intraday calls and puts, and discovered that orders that I was competing against would fill before me, even though I was supposedly the first one on the books(read exchange) on that price. So what? you might say, ""you got unlucky"", no I, you, or anyone else getting buttfucked by Robinhood is not ""unlucky"". The vast, vast majority of option and equity exchanges operate on FIFO w/contingencies. FIFO(First in First Out) means the first person to put up their sell, and first person who put up the bid side will be matched with each other, there is no luck to who gets an order, it who put in that order first. Now ""w/contingencies"" is supposed to be in the retail traders benefit, because that states that, even if a MM places an order before a customer, the customer will still be first. But clearly if you ever traded options on Robinhood, you'd realize **that's not the fucking case.**

So what the heck is goin' on?

I've done many hours of research to come to this conclusion, but all it is my best educated guess, with my knowledge of option order routing. Nothing about how Citadel routes orders, their edge threshold or how much time they hold the orders before moving it somewhere else(read different MM) is all private due to game theory reasons.

I am going to assume that once your order hits Citadels PFOF screens, and they don't want to fill your order at the current price. They will fire an identical order on their end, to the exchange, on your behalf(while nullifying the original order), this removes the CUST order specification, and allows them to get you the worst possible fill, while still giving you the BBO. Certain MM flags exist that actually allow last priority of an order, and it's very possible that they place that on your order. This will 100% of the time have your order be the last one on the books before the bid or ask changes.

&#x200B;

[Last Priority MM Order Flag](https://preview.redd.it/ysbb0tefuwl61.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82c2b29ec8bf7adb389dbe488748e4f25996b4c)

Why would they do this?

They edge themselves by positioning themselves a certain against your executed trade. You getting a shitty fill is Citadel getting an awesome fill. And that is vice versa, you getting an excellent fill is not as good(or shitty) for Citadel, or the MM who picks up your marketable option order. So Citadel wants good fills, and a good edge, so they have to fuck someone over to get that.

What can I do about it?

On other(read real) brokers, you can have your orders sent directly to your desired exchange, without sending directly to a market maker(a market maker can still fill the order on-the-screens), however your order will still have that holy CUST order specification. On Robinhood, there is nothing they can do unless they add execution options and options for specific order instructions, which they won't do.

&#x200B;

tl;dr - When buying options, Citadel likely puts your order on the screens on your behalf(instead of your original order from the app), doing this loses the CUST order specification, which gives your order priority over MMs, and customers trading on brokerages that can shoot orders directly on the exchange will have priority over you. That is the most probable reason as to why Robinhood's order routing is trash.

555,"Detailed DD on the recent rapid $GME price swings, why it's happening and how HF's are making millions off it.","First I want to point out something that should be obvious, but by reading comments here it doesn't appear to be that obvious to many:

1. HF's who lost billions of $$ on $GME...they're not going to attempt to make those losses back on a SINGLE STOCK. Institutions don't get emotionally attached to a single stock.

Now that we have that out of the way, on to the DD:

# Why does $GME have these massive price swings intraday, then crash?

**Answer: Because institutions are pushing the price up, selling at the top, and making millions....here is how they do it.**

1. Buy ITM calls on $GME
   1. *This will appear as a ""large print"" on a number of dif. sites where people literally stare at large volume option buys all day. Typically when a huge buy comes in the options market it's an institution. It would be rare for a retail buyer to be doing 2 million dollar option buys. Often when this happens those apps / discord live chat / reddit have people saying hey look at this massive print, someone must know something.*
2. Buy OTM calls on $GME
   1. *Institution will then buy deep OTM calls. This also would show up as unusual options activity, and just create a confirmation bias based on the first ITM call that got printed.*
3. Buy $GME shares
   1. *Enough to get the price rolling upwards...causing momentum. When you have a stock like $GME that has eyes on it every second of the day during trading hours people notice very quickly when it's on the move. You have a collective mindset that this stock can go to $800 / share, $1,000 / share $10,000 / share ....or $420,000.69 / share. So when the price gets rolling people FOMO buy.*

**This is how an institution can get the price of something moving in the direction they want. Now how do they capitalize on it?**

1. Selling those ITM call options at a massive profit
2. Selling those OTM calls at a massive profit
3. Selling the shares, again, for a massive profit....

However, Institutions are smart, they're not going to dump everything all at once. This is why you'll get these double peaks in the recent trading days. If they sold off everything at once it would almost certainly trip the circuit breakers, that has not happened in a while.

**If an institution today had bought a reasonable portion of $GME at 100,000 shares x $160, and started to sell at $200...they'd make over $4mm dollars. That + the options (and potentially buying puts when it was at $200) it would be easy to clear $20-$100mm a day on $GME with a fairly small amount of capital in terms of institutional money.**

&#x200B;

Again...an institution isn't trying to clear $20 billion on a single trade....you think the SEC isn't going to investigate that? But a $4mm gain... a $20mm gain? even a $100mm gain in a single day? That's nothing, happens all the time and would present zero reason for the SEC to even consider something happening.

What do every single one of those charts have in common? **The stock never closes at the high for the day. It's never a higher strike at 3:59:59pm EST than it was earlier in that same day. (edited for you morons who can't read).**

If I look at unusual options activity for today on $GME I highly doubt that a retail buyer is making a $1.4mm or $1.3mm buy on $GME.

If we look at February -> March of this year it's obvious that institutional money is going into $GME.

# WHY WOULD YOU SPEND $16.5 MILLION DOLLARS ON MARCH 4th BUYING CALLS OF $GAMESTOP AT A $12 STRIKE????

# ...so you can sell them when you pump the price to $200 / share.

but again...before you doubters come out...there is not an institution in the world who's going to dump $100mm into $GME in an attempt to make $1bn + off a single day / trade. No institution is that stupid, or going to do something that is a giant red flag for the SEC to come look at your books.

&#x200B;

""Sentiment Trading"" is becoming a popular topic, and as long as there is a stock as hyped up as $GME...there is going to be institutions making boat loads of money off retail investors who are ""buying the dip""

563,BULL! Cramer will get BTFO'd on Palantir,"My fellow degenerates, it has come to my attention that Jim Cramer (Virgin), has advised his legion of boomers to sell Palantir Technologies. I am posting this to present a long term bullish case for Palantir, and why I think this recent sell-off is a great buying opportunity.

First, I am disputing the reliability of Cramer's picks. According to a 2016 study, the S&P 500 outperformed Cramer by 6% over a 15 year period. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jim-cramer-doesnt-beat-the-market-2016-05-13) .  I further contend that most positive performance is due to boomers mindlessly following his advice and thereby contributing to buying pressure, rather than high quality fundamental or technical analysis.

Second, Palantir Technologies' Gotham Software is widely used throughout government sectors, and it's Foundry Software is becoming largely incorporated for commercial purposes. Palantir has experienced 40% YoY revenue growth, with analyst forecasts of a 68% revenue increase in 2021, and unlike many high-flying tech companies, has not relied on large amounts of debt to sustain itself. This limits the downside risk, and even has Morningstar assigning it an undervalued rating. We are not known as value investors on this thread, but when companies that should be trading at 3x their so called ""fair value"" are trading below it, it's a good sign for full degenerates.

Third, Palantir's RSI is drifting closer to oversold territory, with a 25% increase in shares short since January 29th. The MACD is currently drifting away from the signal line, but we should see bounce back/resistance at around the $20-21 mark, as we did last Friday. This will present a good opportunity for the bulls, as Alex ""The Magic"" Karp kicks the bears back up the stream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0seel/bull_cramer_will_get_btfod_on_palantir/,1615243818.0,123,123,0
564,"Forbes Article: WTF?? Am I a Predator??? NO. I'm a Momma Bear Who Just wants to Provide For Her Kids, and Splurge on herself once in a while. Is that too much to ask????"," TL/DR: Forbes can suck it. This is my rant. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE

   
 

I've reconsidered the Forbes article that came out Friday. The more I think about it, the more pissed I've become about the subtle, manipulative, and just plain evil condescension.

   
 

The writer sounded like they were writing a piece complimenting retail investors on our astute comprehension of the numbers. Basically said the little GME investors were NOT just the ignorant peasants that many experts are trying to portray.


SOUNDS GOOD,  RIGHT?



Well, it was just another headfake, y'all. The writer was framing US (retail investors) as the Goliath, not as the underdog, as the David fighting AGAINST the Goliath.

   
 

Its disgusting. These media shills, including FORBES, are just spewing their own GME panic propaganda. And all the so called 'experts' that say retail investors are 'colluding together' have lost their souls.

   
 

When corrupt leaders at Big Hedgies break the law, and swindle the whole world out of their hard earned dollars...when THEY actually collude to destroy companies, and drive down their stock into bankruptcy for their own profit.....guess what. Crickets.

   
 

NOBODY says or does anything about it. Not the media, not the SEC, not the FBI, not the DTCC, an definitely not Congress. The ONLY reason anyone is 'looking' at it, is because us regular people are now AWAKE to the manipulations and the corruption in every segment of our government and financial sectors. They have to 'look like' they are interested in holding somebody accountable. But they aren't really going after the hedgies. They are going after YOU. ME. DFV. Anyone who dares pull back the curtain.

   
 

But when regular people see a good opportunity, and want to invest, LEGALLY, they lose their shit.

   
 

I don't know ANY of you. I don't take advice from anyone here. I read and research and then make my own decisions.

   
 

But dammit, I see a good opportunity, so I've jumped in the deep end of the pool. I've jumped on the proverbial train. And I will ride it to the end of the line.

   
 

I'm gonna be honest, I'm just tired. I'm tired of living on the edge of broke for years.

I just want to be able to finally get my kid braces. To buy myself my good vehicle, or at least fix the one we have. It has 148K miles and is definitely dont feel safe to travel on roadtrips. I dont even like to drive across Houston, just in case the engine light goes on again.

   
 

My credit is not great, so I cant finance a car. (Don't say it. I've already tried. Twice in 18 months. Every time I try again, it tanks my credit further) And since I'm self employed, I don't have a JOB that pays me a regular paycheck. Therefore the ""Your job is your credit"" financing isnt an option either. So YA, Momma wants a car.

   
 

I want to take a family vacation. Hell I want to take a weekend with my husband every once in a while.

   
 

I want to do fun things, and important things like help my kids go to college, IF they want to.

   
 

I want to be able to give a $100 tip to the struggling server, or even provide a fabulous Christmas for some family in need.

   
 

If this makes me a greedy Bitch, I guess I'm a greedy bitch.

   
 

But it DOESNT make me a criminal. It DOESNT mean I am 'scheming' to manipulate the stock market. OR that I am part of a ""premeditated, predatory take-down of a cornered and defenseless counterparty."" as FORBES claims. ell, WE are the cornered, defenseless counterparty, NOT the multi BILLION DOLLAR Hedge funds!

   
 

Are you friggin' KIDDING ME??? My shares, and even ALL the shares we hold as retail investors do NOT have the power to MOVE the market. The BIG institutions are the ones with the power to actually tank the stock or lift the price.

   
 

WE, the reddit investors, are just little ants on a log; riding the roaring waters of the market, hanging on for dear life! And if we HANG ON, then we can make it to the end of this crazy ride, safe and DRY.

   
 

We SEE the end of the journey and are willing to take that journey. Who are these people to say that we are greedy for just jumping on board and risking our money, even maybe our lives, to arrive at the end of that beautiful run?

   
 

Who are they to say we are greedy for just tagging along, for playing THEIR game, the RIGHT way?

Truth is, these hedge funds hold the investments of millions of innocent investors in their hands. And THEY are the ones who have risked these people's fortunes, their very LIVES, playing a rigged game. THEIR greed and corruption has been revealed.

   
 

And I'm sorry if they are freaking out. But its just what happens when you GET CAUGHT.

   
 

TO BE CLEAR: My goal is not to crash the market or to destroy hedge funds, even tho I think some people should go to jail for their illegal activities.

   
 

I just want to ride the rapids. To take the risk and get the payout I know is coming. Not because I know I'm so deserving, but because I know the numbers don't lie. That's not criminal. Its not even shady. Its SMART.

   
 

I will end up in a calm, peaceful lake, surrounded by big beautiful mountains. I will finally be able to enjoy the view. I will send my kids to college, buy those braces, buy safe car, and even go on a beautiful vacation.

   
 

And hey Forbes, hey Cramer. Hey all you crooks investigating DFV.....listen up.

   
 

THATS not greedy. Its INEVITABLE.

   
 

(NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE. DO WHATEVER THE HELL YOU WANNA DO. I LIKE THE STOCK)

   
 

   
 

   


EDIT:

Seriously tho. We are bonded together by a common goal and common struggles. No matter our color, gender, race, religion or political ideology, the real war is against evil and corruption. For the right to pursue our own destinies and our own version of happiness.


""We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."" - Ephesians 6:12 KJV

565,"$FSLR DD - 5/21 CALL, $70 strike","Wanted to provide some DD on a company that I feel has potential, $FSLR (First Solar).

I noticed this company after I received an alert about unusual options activity:

>$FSLR 5/21/2021 $70  
Type: CALLS  
Order: 926 @ 10.94  
Premium: $1,012,806  
Underlying: $76.55  
Daily Volume: 943  
OI: 46

Someone is clearly making a big bet that this company is going to be on the rise over the coming months. This company wasn't on my radar before, so after digging and research, I placed a similar call order. There has been a significant dip over the past few and I believe this is a good buy-in point for a few reasons outlined below.

**Price target:** $88.36 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSLR/))

**What they do:**

First Solar designs, develops, manufactures and markets a line of thin-film semiconductor photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules that convert sunlight into electricity.

**Analyst's Investment Thesis:**

>We believe that First Solar is well positioned for future growth based on its solid balance sheet and focus on cadmium telluride technology, which should provide a cost advantage relative to more commoditized technologies like polysilicon.  The company is also benefiting from an expanding opportunity set of utility-scale projects. First Solar's balance sheet is clean and it has a solid book of contracted projects heading into the next few years. First Solar could also be an attractive acquisition target for an integrated oil company looking to bolster its renewable operations. We caution, however, that FSLR shares have a history of volatility, and that any sales or earnings disappointment could result in a sharp selloff. As such, we view FSLR as appropriate only for risk-tolerant investors as part of a diversified portfolio.

Solar is a growing industry, so placing a bet on any front-runner in this space isn't a bad play.

How are you all feeling about solar coming into the summer?",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m1a908/fslr_dd_521_call_70_strike/,1615307693.0,5,5,0

Everyone is losing their minds..

Oh no. The internet is taking over! The stream wars is upon us! Obi One Stay Homie because of the pandemic...

Yeah yeah yeah.

Your forgetting key fundamentals to the current film industry though!

You see. Movie theaters....
They sell you an experience!
You wait in line with a bunch of ganja scented slackers in front of you and that weird guy with his mom behind you. You get your 🎟, and immediately your babe is like, I want popcorn and raisinettes. So you spend $40 on some snacks and drinks and you go in this super dark room with a bunch of strangers and nothing but a kid with a broom and an endless supply of gum for security.

You, hopefully, were smart enough to pick out some dope seats. You watch some movie theatre exclusive commercials, and you enjoy watching the movie and reacting with the crowd during scenes where gasps and laughs are acceptable. You finish, stick around for post scene credits, and leave your shit on the ground like its your first time getting laid.

What am I getting at here?!

Lets take a worst case scenario. Disney, Paramount and everyone else in the world says 'go screw yourself"" to AMC. They get no new movies. Ever again.

""Yo, general public!"" Shouts out AMC! ""Were hosting a Marvel Avengers marathon for the next 35 days! Every fucking movie released by Marvel since 1913, we are playing, come check it out!""

You like the Dark Night? We got that.

Ever wondered why Frozen is just the Lion King rehashed into a Disney Princess for the fan girls who don't give a fuck about Mufasa? We will play them back to back with a live rendition of Macbeth an enlighten you to the truth!

AMC has so many movies, they could create a monthly subscription for you to go out and watch old shit on the big screen and rake in 50 times the profits they currently do for the next 1000 years!

Foundry is going to change the foundation of the typical supply chain with seamless data integration for live predictive models and active problem solving. With AWS, AMZN, offering an ERP suite with PLTR tech allows companies to save money instantly by integrating data to allow AI to find ways to be more profitable. BP saved 50 million within two weeks of using Foundry.

Gotham has been a staple for the U.S. military for active decision making and ""Gotham is an AI-ready platform that improves and accelerates decisions for operators at every echelon and in every domain — land, sea, air, space, and cyber.""

Any company that has massive amounts of data will turn to use PLTR services and continue to expand the commercial growth of the company. One of the biggest gripes of PLTR was its overreliance of revenue in the government sector. We are at a pivotal time where the company will continue to add contracts and get closer to profitability. Once we were completely out of the pandemic, companies will want to free up more capital to supplement the growth of the overall market i.e. higher operations costs. If you are discouraged, I would watch these demos. It will excite you.

Now the reason for the post; physical games are NOT going away. Why? Because they offer so much value in the re-sale world. Let me give an example, I own a Nintendo switch, in fact I own 2 (both bought at GameStop thank you) and I started playing Zelda Breath of the Wild. I made sure to buy the physical copy for one reason, I want to sell it back for trade in value when I’m done. Currently there is **no option for reselling games purchased virtually**, not even a plan. Why would anyone want to buy a virtual game? The short answer is some people are just lazy and want it now, but if I can buy Zelda for $80 and sell it on ebay/ offer up for $50 why would I ever buy virtual games?!?! Not everyone thinks about ROI, but I know most of you apes do. The resellers world is on fire and video games – even retro – are hot right now.

586,Why you should buy Sonos (SONO) tomorrow,"Listen up all you man babies.  If you're interested in making money the play tomorrow is to buy Sonos (SONO) before 3 PM EST.  Why is that time so specific?  Because tomorrow Sonos is having an investor day in the afternoon.  Where they will announce new products! Talking about the future! And (likely) raise their 2021 guidance! 

Sonos is one of the more undervalued companies still on the market and below I talk about reasons you should get in now.  They are a well positioned company for both 'stay home' and 'reopen' trades and their CEO is a boss.  They will crush tomorrow and the weakness their stock showed today on low volume should be taken advantage of immediately. 

TL;DR?  Buy Sonos on its weakness today and get in tomorrow before 3 PM EST to get in on this moon mission. 

**What is a Sonos?**

*From Yahoo: Sonos, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, designs, develops, manufactures, and sells multi-room audio products in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific. The company provides wireless speakers, home theater speakers, components, and accessories. It offers its products through approximately 10,000 third-party retail stores, including custom installers of home audio systems; and e-commerce retailers, as well as through its Website* [*sonos.com*](https://sonos.com)*. The company was formerly known as Rincon Audio, Inc. and changed its name to Sonos, Inc. in May 2004. Sonos, Inc. was founded in 2002 and is headquartered in Santa Barbara, California.* 

Basically Sonos makes incredible home speakers and audio related devices mostly for an at home setting.  They hold over 775 patents and are currently applying for over 500 more. Their speaker systems are so solid that Alphabet (google) and Amazon have tried to steal their technology. Sonos is currently in litigation against both of them and they've said they except to have the Alphabet litigation settled in their favor by the end of the year (GREAT FOR EARNINGS). 

**Reasons for buying them long term:**

I could spend this whole post talking about how they saw the coming supply chain issues and quickly worked through them.  How their CEO is has partnered with IKEA to get Sonos' systems in front of eyeballs who are looking to buy new furniture and now can add a TV sound system on the way out, or how they are going to release up to 3 new products this year. No I'm only going to focus on TOMORROW. 

**Reason #1 for buying them TOMORROW:** 

New product announced.  Go look at Sonos' stock twits, Seeking Alpha page, or even their Yahoo Finance new feed.  No one is talking about their new product they're going to announce.  It's already been leaked.  It's the Sonos Roam.  A lightweight wireless speaker where you can take anywhere.  A fantastic new addition to their stable as people want to spend more time outside this year. 

[Here's a link to the Verge talking about the details of it](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22317082/sonos-roam-features-trueplay-sound-swap-leak-specs-price)

But here's why this is important. The average investor or algo hasn't picked up on this because it hasn't hit any of the media they cover.  It's going to be new information to them.  While you'll have the leg up on it. 

The Roam is likely to be their main announcement tomorrow but since they leaked this people are expecting another announcement, like in the headphone space.  

To give you an idea of how big the headphone announcement might be Kingston just sold the HyperX headphone brand to HP, for nearly half a billion dollars.  If you give Sonos that same market cap increase, that's worth 12% upside from it's closing price today. 12%! Because of a product announcement. 

**Reason #2 management wants to talk 2021 guidance:** 

Let's imagine you're having an investor day a month after you last earnings call. Things are going just okay.  Do you want to make it a point to talk guidance during your new product presentation? NO, you don't.  You hope things get better and just reaffirm you current guidance.  

Now let's pretend things are going great.  That your team is currently crushing the current Q's numbers.  You have an investor day coming up, what a perfect opportunity to tell everyone that you're going to raise guidance and likely crush those low numbers again with the new products. 

Situation number 2 is what is likely to happen. Management made it a point to let people know they'll be talking earnings and guidance during the meeting tomorrow. Management only does this if they're confident. 

**Reason #3 no supply chain issues:**

I'm cheating a little, this is more of a long term investment reason but it's likely to get brought up tomorrow.  Sonos' management team has been open about their supply chain struggles last year, and vowed to fix them.  During their last conference call they talked about how with the latest shipping issues they were not caught flat footed and have a solid pipeline of materials to build their products. Which is likely why they might raise guidance tomorrow. 

**Reason #4 new partnerships for Sonos Radio:** 

I'll let others who have Beams talk about this, not just me, but Sonos radio is super solid and an amazing long term growth addition to Sonos' catalog of products. The streaming service is fantastic when you just want a mood or type of music but don't want to deal with Spotify or Pandora playlists. They've been getting bigger and bigger names to partner up with them and create a curated playlist.  They will likely announce a few new ones tomorrow, and talk in detail about the reoccurring revenue of Sonos Radio. 

**In conclusion:**

Sonos is one of the few companies I feel it worthwhile to take a risk on in this environment. Its got huge long term tailwinds that I'm happy to talk about in more detail, but tomorrow is going to be a big uppie day.  So feel free to be in on Sonos with a cheaper buy in price.  Than buy in on Wednesday for 10% more.

590,Options Game on AMC is on FIRE right now!," Alright fellow simians, I am hoping we are evolving enough to where we can begin talking specifics in terms of the options market on our beloved AMC. I know many are hesitant, fearing that if specific prices aren't reached by Friday, younger apes in the pack may grow scared and begin to doubt our journey. I am hoping by now we have done enough research on the market itself to now understand specific pricing goals and not be discouraged by them if the week doesn't go as planned.

TLDR: If you are like me and data makes your snake hiss, or your cat growl for my ape sisters, stick around. If you're going to pout and take your ball home if we happen to miss a target price come friday, GTFOH...Sorry for yelling, I still love you, (bro hug).

Alright so as a nerd at heart a good spread sheet to me can beat a free premium pornhub account especially when it's a spreadsheet about boosting our AMC and speeding up the count down to our moon launch.

As you should all know, the options market and corresponding weekly Gamma squeezes will help push our rocket towards the launch pad much quicker than just the buy and hold campaign. Now, options are a different breed and can burn young gun apes bad so I am not suggesting playing ""just the tip"" with them if you do not fully understand the risk. Think playing said game with a cigar cutter...

Anyways, options have huge impact on stock price as each contract is for 100 shares. So the more contracts that are sold by market makers, the more 100x shares they must purchase the following monday at market price if the contracts are exercised. This is the foundation of Gamma. If you're not tracking and want to learn more, please reach out. Seriously, I'm not a weirdo, I'm not offering you free candy out of a sketchy van, I just know that the smarter our pack gets and learns the game, the worse it is for the Hedge Fucks. I am not an advisor, so I will not and do not give advice, but I will give information and hypotheticals for my ape brothers and sisters to make their own decisions.

In an earlier post this weekend I commented on how absurd (good thing) the options game is right now on AMC. AMC is now has the 11th most active options contracts. Yes, AMC, movie theaters. If you don't get why that is unfucking believable you must have been fortunate enough to be in a coma during the wet fart on first date of a year that was 2020 thanks to the rona.

Anyways, currently there are 5735 contracts ATM at 8.05 expiring this friday. That means 573,500 share become purchased by douche fucks like Ken Griffins Citadel the following monday, should all contracts be exercised. That's a lot of buying pressure in it's self.

Now at a strike of 8, if market prices is at or above 8.79 the number of options ITM is 27,688 or 2,768,800 shares at stake... how would you feel about that if you were shorted on AMC? Personally, I'd be curled up under my desk crysterbating while sucking my other thumb...

Below is a table I made listing the price at which options are ATM and the number of contracts that would be ATM or ITM at strikes below these are for all contracts sold expiring Friday (3/12):

7.98: 43 options ATM 4300 shares

8.03: 615 options ATM 65,800 shares

8.04: 3604 options ATM 360,400 shares

8.05: 5735 options ATM 573,500 shares

8.14: 8,054 options ATM 805,400 shares

8.38: 12,358 options ATM 1,235,800 shares

8.79: 27,688 options ATM 2,678,800 shares

Now sharing this info is meant to help shareholders know the power of the options game and keeping the weekly monday Gamma cycle going. I haven't done the research for this past friday. But the 8.01 buzzer beater that left me needing to change my jocks two weeks ago gave us a 14.5% jump that following monday.

""But why then are we still hovering around 8?!?! I want more and I want it now! Wahhh!""

Well that's because the HFs still had ladder attack power to push things back down by week's end. You beloved apes buying more stonk and holding it is taking that power away slowly. The less shares they have for ladder attack bullshit the more/longer that monday gamma price spike will hold.

As you can see above, things are good at almost any price above 8. But the 8 dollar call had a 10,000+ increase in the number of contracts sold at that strike last week compared to the week prior, hence the more than double resulting power compared to 8.38 (which is an 8 call sold a while back at a premium of .38 a share)

So for me personally, and not advising anyone to bandwagon, I'm going to be cheering for 8.80 at Friday's close so those 27,688 contracts containing 2,768,800 shares are ITM.

But even if it doesn't quite make it, I'll still have a smile ear to ear as I know the options ITM below are still pretty damn powerful in the fight against douche bags like Gabriel Plotkin and the rest of the Hedge Fucks...",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0nm3u/options_game_on_amc_is_on_fire_right_now/,1615231298.0,201,201,0
591,The January Halt,"Is it possible that the halt in January actually have done more damage to the HFs than if the halt didnt happen and the squeeze squoze?

I mean when the January squeeze was about to happen this was all new and not that many (including me) knew about it. I first heard about it when it was around $270 and jumped on the rocket. By now many of us has been averaging down alot which means we holding a much bigger percentage of the stock and more and more people have jumped on the rocket by time.

Also the people right now have been through fucking hell which leads that they not letting go of the shares easy. If this would have happened in January I think a big percentage would have been satisfied and sold around $1000. Now it’s a whole different scenario where we been fighting hard and we see more value in the shares. The HFs will not get them cheap to say the least. 

Just speculating and curious what you fellow monkeys think about it!

599,Why $NIO is a good buy,"This is my first DD, feel free to go in raw and no rubber, nuts to butts with your criticism

1. Backed by the CCP

“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))

The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.

&#x200B;

2. Reasons for recent price movements

There are two causes for the recent price movements. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:

* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3
* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3
* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3
* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3

While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.

The second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))

&#x200B;

3. Market Cap compared to competitors

$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly.

&#x200B;

4. Potential for future growth

Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.

$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j

&#x200B;

5. The actual products

In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for 30 minutes without a supercharger, or one hour without one before being able to drive 44 miles (source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive.

&#x200B;

With the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.

**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

You might have noticed that I didn't mention Tesla at all. That's because they have developed their own Linux-based Operating system, which Tesla has been having trouble getting it approved by US safety regulations. QNX on the other hand, already is. $BB to the fucking moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀""

3) BB is a cash flow positive, growing company with near nil competitors in an industry that is skyrocketing. Despite this, the boomer fucks who still believe BB is a smartphone company, have in their own glorious act of autism, have massively shorted BB bringing the share price down. 

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/) 

TLDR: hedge funds caught with their dicks in their hands are about to get Royally Fucked as the market corrects itself with a BB rise over the next month

**Short Interest (SI)** image included indicates that shorts covering has helped but they are still at a low level meaning historically this is relatively the lowest amount of shares shorted this year.  There is still enough shorts to help the price action upward and also enough to give stability to this big increases if they call it quits.

**Implied Volatility (IV)** is up but the contract premiums during the first squeeze were significantly higher.  For example, on 1/29 the stock was around $325 and the contract costs were:

At The Money (ATM) strike $325 1 wk option cost about $125

Today....ATM strike $195 1 wk option cost about $30.

Two things, 1) there is much less IV b/c this was a much slower and methodical rise albeit still over a short time period.  2) Since options premiums are still relatively cheap around $30 ATM I think (correct if wrong) they are still affordable enough to continue pressuring a gamma squeeze.

Implied 1 wk move is 15% ($30/$200) +/-  based on the contract prices.  This is much better than the plus or minus 38% ($125/$325) +/- 1 wk move last time.

**Technicals.**  I don't look at technicals but I'm thinking this is one view you can add to your technical view about where there is support and what the options market is pricing in.  The idea of this **falling back to $100 isn't supported by the options market.**

**Edit:** I think this also shows that a short squeeze wasn't needed to get us where we are right now.  Which is good b/c if it's a gamma squeeze then it's repeatable as we just witnessed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0qxq2/latest_gme_short_interest_data_from_ihors3_at_s3/,1615239746.0,86,86,0

Hey my fellow apes,

I bought into GME high. I got into GME at 10 shares @ \~$300. On Friday Feb 5th, after market close, I decided I was just gonna call it a loss and close my position in GME the following Monday at market open. That Saturday, I drove 4 hours home and surprised my mom at my aunts house.

My aunt put together a birthday dinner for my mom and I thought it would be a nice surprise for her to see her son on her b-day. It was a fun party. We ate, drank, and played games into the evening. At one point though, my aunt remembered something.

She and her spouse moved her old ass couch out of her home to the dump the previous week. In the process of moving however, she found a wallet inside.

The wallet was my first wallet ever. It still had my 7th grade student ID card, locker combination, and class schedule inside. What really made my testies tingle though was the Gamestop Value card that was inside.

Of all the times over the last 15 years that this wallet could have been found, it remained hidden until the very time I needed it most. If this wasn't a sign from God or w/e you do or don't believe in, I don't know what is.

After coming across this card my paperhands solidified into solid fucking diamonds. I watched the price like a hawk and bought the dip. I'm in 20 shares at \~$190 now and I'M NOT FUCKIN LEAVIN.",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m00gqa/i_got_a_sign_from_aboveall_the_dd_i_needed/,1615153475.0,10841,10841,0
616,May the force be with you. AMC management is at war and are telling us that they hear us with the vote date.,"Am I the only one here thinking that the picked date is not random for AMC vote?

I’m just an ape that barely survived natural selection, but I’ve seen everywhere that this vote will make sure that every owner of shares exist. They’ll have to count the real shares and the counterfeit ones. Shorters will have to cover or do something, I don’t know exactly what’s the consequences of owning a counterfeit share, but I guess that they’ll have to do something. 

We know that AMC management love retail investors. We saved them after these shorters tried to pull the rug under their feet. 

I think the date is definitely not random and they are also in war and sending us a message. 

May the force be with us! They are also going to war. 

Also Star War movies are top 10 to 17 in the top 100 movies of AMC.

Edit: the date of the vote for the fellow apes that doesn’t know anything about star wars is May the 4th (with the Mike Tyson kind of voice). May the forsssse",https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0eqv8/may_the_force_be_with_you_amc_management_is_at/,1615206808.0,487,487,0

620,Betting LLY Has Found a Treatment for Alzheimer's,"Potentially huge news coming this week.

Eli Lily shocked everyone in January with a preliminary report that their new drug **slowed the effects of Alzheimer's BY 32%**. The stock jumped almost 12% on the news, but most analysts have been waiting on actual details to verify their results. 

**Those details are coming THIS SATURDAY, March 13th** at the Alzheimer's disease conference. The data has been previewed already by Lilly’s chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, who said: “From our own analysis and the small number of experts we’ve shared the data with, we surely believe a very substantial advance in Alzheimer’s research has been accomplished.”

This is not advice, just my own opinion:

***I am all in on shares and options with about $27k.***
