Debt collector letter,"Hi! I recently received a letter from a debt collector. Which first of all is odd, because I pay my bills on time every month. The letter does not have mine or my husband's name on it and it also has an account number from Comcast that is not our account number. It was addressed to our apartment complex corporate but has our apartment number on it. I checked our Comcast account just to be sure we dont owe them anything, and we do not apart from next month's bill. Should I contact this company to tell them they have the wrong people or just ignore it? Thanks!

Asset allocation and buying a property," I was really good at having money invested in index-funds and letting it compound over time and re-invest.. I got tired over the years of not owning an apartment and constantly traveling and moving.. and when I would rent not ever feeling like it was a permanent hope because landlords would raise rents once you get comfortable, etc..

Anyway. I wanted a place to call my own.. I took one-third of the money and bought a property outright in cash.. I know you are suppose to get mortgages, but I don't have a job and wouldn't have qualified for one, even having assets.

I partially regret the decision of being overly allocated in one asset class and not having dividends being generated from 1/3 of asset plus the capital appreciation with stocks and bonds..

has anyone else done something like this?

College for stepdaughter,"I hope this is the right sub to post this in; apologies if not. I just got married to a woman who has a 17 year old daughter. This daughter wants to go to college (good for her).  Problem is that the mother and I just graduated with huge school debts. We both come from disciplines that have a terrible debt to income ratio for our course of study (150k debt each), bring in ~60-80k each. So combined our income will be fairly high, however, so will our debt. While I do understand we can deduct student loan interest...we still won't be able to throw much at school nor do we want to. Both of us are/were 100% responsible for our own loans (but we did it late in life where parents income didn't matter) and we want her to be as well. I am concerned that she will not be able to get financial aid in her own name due to our income.  Looking online makes it appear that emancipation for financial aid reasons is difficult. 

It seems like this situation would be fairly common. So does anyone have knowledge of how to get loans without the parent income?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ixo8t/college_for_stepdaughter/,1482022008

Should my non-retirement investments mirror my IRA's portfolio?,"I'm 23 years old and have about 20k (15k Roth, 5k non-retirement) with an investment broker that sells front-loaded funds (about 5%). I'd rather not get into the discussion of front-loaded vs none (or virtually none as is the case with Vanguard) as I think these types of investments do have their place.

However, for me, I think I can find more value choosing my own investments and going a low-cost route with Vanguard. In January I plan to open a new Roth with Vanguard and max out my contributions using a simple 3 fund portfolio.

My question is, as I'm contributing to my non-retirement accounts throughout the year should I mirror the portfolio found in my Roth? What do some of you suggest?

Can I move a 401k to an IRA to a Roth IRA before tax time?,"Hi! I'm new here and have a question. If I have violated any rules in this post, please point me in the right direction.   
  
I left my job a while back and have about 25k in a 401k. I'm starting a new business and will eventually start contributing to my own retirement plan. How do I move the 401k to an IRA and then move it again to a Roth IRA and can this be done within one taxable year? I'd like to ""take the tax hit"" this year as I've made much less this year than I did last year and will probably make next year, so 2016 would be the best year for me to make the move.  
  
I guess my main questions are do I have to move a 401k to an IRA first before moving it to a Roth? Can I do it in the same tax year? And is there anything I should look out for when opening my accounts?

I read all the stuff and still don't totally get how best to use an IRA at my (high) income.

I'm maxing out my 401(k) at $18K. Now I want to have an IRA. From what I read, I make too much for a Roth IRA (over $117K right?), and I don't get the tax deduction from a traditional IRA (I think?) So I'm supposed to do a ""backdoor IRA"" and contribute to a traditional IRA and then convert it to a Roth IRA? Is that right?

Can someone explain to me exactly how I do that? Like literally, where do I sign up, where do I get the money from (it doesn't come out of my payroll right? I just do it from my bank account?), and how does one do this conversion?

"With company contributions, am I better off with Roth or Traditional 401K?","I know this is a case by case basis, and in general if you are further away from retirement, you are better off contributing after tax. However, I am wondering if the math get's muddled when taking into account company contributions.  Right now I am contributing to a Roth 401K, due to the higher contribution limits.  I put in 8% per year and my company with match and initial contribution puts in a total of 7%.  Currently all this money is after tax.  I am 27, married - 2 kids, and my wife does not work.  The standard deduction puts us just slightly into the 25% tax bracket, however, the vast majority of our earnings would be at 15%.  Should we continue with a Roth account, or would the company match amount - effectively an immediate 88% ROI make the traditional 401K a better option due to the higher company match amount?

Investment question for my sister. Keep shopping strip and make 4K a month or sell for 1.8 mil,"This is for my sister. She is going through a divorce. My soon to be ex-bro-n-law is in commercial real estate. One of his properties is a strip center that makes around 8-10k a month in profit. It was bought while they were married so sister has solid claim to 1/4 of it. STBXBIL has a business partner that has the other 1/2 of it. They split profits 50/50. Sister found and worked most of the deal to get the center 2 years ago so she is emotionally invested in it. STBXBIL has offered his 1/4 to her as part of the divorce settlement. If she accepts the business parter has also offered to buy sisters 1/2 for 1.8 mil. The original price was 3 mil for the whole property. Sorry for the long back story but now to the question. If she accepts the settlement, which she is leaning yes to, should she keep the property and make 4-5k a month with little work but still have to deal somewhat with ex-husband and his business or sell and invest that money somewhere else for retirement. If she sells and invests what is the safest yet most profitable retirement plan?  She has about 25-30 years to retirement. Her main job is a teacher.

(CAN) calculating Lease and financing rates for a car,"I've been doing some calculations for leasing and financing cars, and I'm trying to calculate lease rates on cars. Now, I've run into some issues, and am not sure what to do next. I'm trying to include effective APR on leasing rates but I'm having trouble with the calculation. I've included a 20% down payment on each car, so I'm only paying for the remaining 80% over a 60 month period with 2.99% APR annually. but at this point I'm confused. Am I paying the APR on the principal (that 80%) or am I paying that APR on what I've paid off of that year on which the APR is added. In other words, if I spent $2,000 in one year on a lease with 2% APR, would it be on that $2,000 dollars or the principal I paid on the whole car? Also, the calculation is 

Pi=P(1+r/n)^tn

Pi=principal plus interest

P=principal

r=rate

n=frequency of compounding

Options on old family home?,Hey i'm 22 years old and there are three other people in on this deal with me and the deal is: I want to buy a house that has been in my family for a couple years.

My parents used a close family friend to buy a larger house in the metro Detroit area in the 2000s in this friends name.

I know I should have let it slip into foreclosure but I REALLY wanted the house and property. I got rid of my apartment and moved in but the house needs ALOT of repairs. There is 135000$ left on the refinanced mortgage but the house appraised for 60000$ recently. My dad is currently pushing a short-sale because the family friend wants out of the deal.

So, my questions:  1. What credit score will Get you approved for financing at all (bare minimum score needed to be accepted at most dealers) 2. Does the size of what we can put down in cash the day off help with negotiating, if so, to what extent. &amp; 3. What score would get us a good interest rate?

My 2015 Tax Refund is still processing?,"My 2015 taxes were filed on time and digitally by an accountant. A few weeks later, I received a letter from IRS asking for a form (has to do with health insurance), which the accountant promptly submitted. A couple of months pass, and I still have not received my refund. When I call IRS, they tell me that they have all the necessary information from me, but the representative was not able to tell me why my refund was not processing.

New employer wants to contact current employer to confirm employment dates and compensation,"I received an offer of employment a couple of days ago.  The offer is contingent on three things: I pass a background check, I pass a drug screening, and they confirm my employment dates and compensation with my current employer.  The only problem I have is with the 3rd item.  

The new job told me that once I've passed my background check and drug screening, they will call me and ask me to give my current job my two weeks notice and ultimately resign from that position.  

The recruiter at the new company told me that once I've put in my two weeks notice with my current employer, they will then contact my current employer to confirm my dates of employment and my compensation.  The recruiter said that it is very normal for the current employer to fire me rather than letting me finish out my two weeks (I live in Texas, where this practice is allowed). I don't actually mind if my current job doesn't let me finish my two weeks...  I don't want to work there anymore, and I am very excited about the new job.  

I have a some issues with the new employer contacting my current employer.  The first issue is that I currently work for a very small company with no formal HR department, so the new job will have to talk to the owner of the firm I currently work at (my boss) to confirm my dates of employment and compensation. My boss is not a nice man and is not aware of laws regarding how a current employer cannot say negative things about an employee that is looking for a new job. Basically, he might say bad things about me to the new employer, thereby sullying my reputation. 

On top of this, there is a very large chance he simply won't return the calls or emails of my new employer, because he doesn't want to aid me in getting a new job.  I know my boss pretty well, and I firmly believe that he will either talk negatively about me, or will ignore the requests of my new employer to confirm my employment.  This may seem like I am overreacting and just assuming the worst will happen, but I have worked for this man for years now and have gotten to know how he handles situations where employees are seeking new jobs.  He does not handle it well.

I need advice on how I can navigate this issue with the new employer.  They have already mailed me the offer of employment.  I have signed the offer and sent it back.  I will certainly pass the background check and drug screening.  I would be absolutely devastated if I don't end up finally getting the job because my boss said horrible things about me, or because he ignored their requests.  

Given this sticky situation, is there anyway I can explain this to the new employer, without making it sound like I am hiding something from them such as me being a bad employee?  I would much rather confirm my dates of employment by providing them with pay stubs, or my W2s, or really anything else.  It also really confuses me that the new employer literally gave me the written offer of employment, an entire 200 page packet of information containing documents relating to benefits, confidentiality agreements, compliance-related materials, etc.  I don't understand why they would extend the offer to me when it is only contingent that they are able to speak to my current employer.  

Plus, the new company is a giant, global company with thousands of employees.  So, I feel like this is their standard operating procedures - to contact people's current employers to confirm compensation and employment dates.  I don't want to seem like I'm hiding something, or like I am trying to get them to change their hiring procedures.  But, to put it as simply as possible, I don't want them to contact my current employer because I am nervous about how he will react, and that he may ruin my chances of becoming employed with the new company. The nightmare scenario would be that my current boss would fire me, and then say such horrible things about me to the new job that they don't even end up hiring me because of the bad reference. What should I do?

Credit Utilization really slamming my credit,"Hello PF, I recently graduated with a degree in Finance and just moved into my first apartment. Seeing how I owned no furniture, I put it all on my credit card. I usually put everything I can on my credit card. It's always made sense to do so because I end up getting cash back.

This irritates me and I don't know what to do. I've raked up high balances almost as large before, but my credit was never hit by over 10 points. I've never been late on a single payment for anything. From my view I was making smart financial decisions.

"Regarding ""Insurance Broker"" recruitment scams","I've seen a few topics here regarding being recruited to sell life insurance, and if it's legitimate or not. It seems too good to be true that a legitimate company called regarding your Monster resume and set up and interview to just hand you a potential six figure job with commission. Well if this has happened to you, I have a single word of advice that will save you thousands of dollars:

#Run! 

Less than savory life insurance companies will look for people desperate for a job with no qualifications, and hire them up to cold call and sell life insurance door to door. They'll trot out phoney ""top performers"" to tell candidates how easy it is and extol how lucrative their incentive programs are. The guy talking will probably mention being awarded a BMW or something for his sales. 

So why is this a scam, you ask? Because while the company will most likely award commission based on 80% or so of six months worth of the plan's paid premiums, they will pay it out all at once in the form of a PAY DAY LOAN, and won't tell you they did so. If your customer drops the plan in less than a year (and statically they will), you are now in debt for whatever commission you were paid plus interest!! They will only call that debt in when you try to leave, so unbeknownst to you it will pile up over the year or so you try to tough it out. The company will try it's damnedest to try and keep you there long enough to make money off of you, offering to have you attend sales lectures, trainings, and maybe even have you shadow that ""top sales guy"" who enticed you during their initial pitch. After all, ""You want to retire as a millionaire at 40, don't you!?""

Unbelievably, this is legal. You won't be able to sue them; their lawyers all know why you're about to sue them and already have an airtight case against you in case you do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5hbjnm/regarding_insurance_broker_recruitment_scams/,1481254044

19 year student loan to go another 10+ years?,"Hi... any advice is appreciated.

I'm a 41 year old male who graduated from a large state university in 1998. At the time, I consolidated student loans into about $10k from a single lender.

In 2005, I had a mis-directed notion that I'd move to the medical community, and took out a small $1500 loan with a community college. I was told at the time that it would be merged with my original loan and terms.

Apparently however, a new loan was created at the time with yet another 20 year term, due to mature when I am over 50 years old.

To me, and speaking to that loan rep 11 years ago - that meant a merger with the existing loan. Now (the loan has been resold several times over 18 years), the customer service reps tell me that the 2005 loan was a new (20 year loan) and that while I have a $4000 balance, it may take until I'm near 60 to pay off?!?!

Sadly, I did not keep the paperwork from the loan merger in 2005.

I now have a decent job, and could in theory pay off this loan - but I do not want to be scammed. I was told in 1998 that this loan would be paid off in 10 years, which has long since passed.

The kids that answer the phone at the current servicer, don't seem to understand the notion of an ""amortization schedule"". They repeatedly tell me to pay this loan until I'm 50+.

While I'm now of a healthy financial state to pay this off now - that doesn't mean that I'm ready to do so. I do not want to be scammed any more.

Any thoughts on whether I should contact an attorney? I gotta think that there are alot of middle-aged people with aging student loans.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kug7o/19_year_student_loan_to_go_another_10_years/,1482980107

-Both with 6 figure incomes
-Recently married this year (late in the year).  Didn't change our W4s until late November, so I'm worried we didn't withhold enough.
-Husband was previously on a work visa, and became a permanent resident this year (not sure if that matters for tax purposes). 
-Husband works for same company, but was working in another state (state 1) for the first half of 2016, and is now working remote full-time/permanently from our home state (state 2).

"IRS wants $2,258 from me by January","Hello, yesterday I received a CP2000 notice from the IRS stating that I owe $2,258 by January 11, 2017. To say the least I was shocked, as I am just a student working to pay my tuition and I definitely don't have that type of money to just throw around. 


Per the form, it states that, ""we need to verify the education credits you claimed on Form 1040 lines 50 or 68, or Form 1040A lines 33 or 44. Higher education institutions can report either amounts you paid for qualified expenses (box1) or amounts they billed (box 2) on Forms 1098-T, Tuition Statement. We don't consider amounts they billed you in box 2 as proof of actual expenses you paid. Provide a signed detailed explanation of the amounts you paid to support the amounts claimed.""


I used TurboTax to fill out my taxes and had all my forms imported electronically, and the numbers seem to match up on my 1098-T from what I can tell. It seems like they are trying to get me to pay $1200 for Education Credits from line 33, and an additional $1000 for American opportunity credit from line 44 (plus $58 interest). 


I am mostly confused at why they want me to pay these credits back and also what information they want from me so that I don't have to pay them back?


Edit: So I'm realizing now where the discrepancies are coming from. Spring 2016 semester I studied abroad but I still was enrolled and received financial aid through my school. So in December 2015 the amount billed was probably about $4000 but none of that was actually paid to the school, but I did pay $8000 to the Study Abroad Program (not related to my school, but I was still able to stay enrolled at my school). Also, the $8000 was not paid until January, 2016. Do you know if I'm able to send those receipts as proof?

I was automatically enrolled in my graduate school's health insurance program. Anything I can do about this?,"So I got a full ride to a graduate program and stayed in touch with the financial aid and other university services throughout my matriculation process. I was under the impression that I did not need to do anything else prior to matriculation and have written confirmation of a university employee telling me this. Unfortunately, my university did not directly tell me I had to specifically opt out of their $3000 health insurance plan if I was planning to stay on my parent's plan (I'm 24, their insurance is better and cheaper), and I got the bill today.

I checked my email, and among over 100 irrelevant emails the university sent me was one that claimed that if I did not waive the health insurance by the start of the program, I would be automatically enrolled in their ""plus"" plan. This was written at the bottom of a long email, and was not emphasized in any way.

I received no confirmation, email, written, or otherwise, that I was on the plan when it started. I know I messed up here. I guess I should've been reading all of those emails, but when you're getting 4-5 emails a day about things completely irrelevant to you on an account you don't even use yet, things slip through the cracks.

Is it more financially responsible for me to drop out of college at this point rather than continue?,"I have ~$80,000 (current net amount after accrued interest) in student loan debt from a college in another country that I attended for 2 years. The credits don't transfer so I had to start college from scratch when I came back to US. I maxed out the subsidized and unsubsidized loans and the rest are through Parent PLUS. All loans are currently in deferment.

I go to a community college costing $2,600/semester. My parents, worried about my large student loan, decided to pay for my community college. They make about $170,000 a year between the two of them, but my father is horrible with savings (and he makes 80% of that) and is currently $11,000 in credit card debt. 

There are about 3-4 more years until I can graduate college. I'm only there part time because I work part time in retail making $10/hr. I've made two $650 payments on the biggest Parent PLUS loan. Because of where we live, most of my money goes to gas (45 minute drive each way to work or college), and the rest I save for the loan payments as I can make them, and a little treat of ice cream or a coffee once or twice a month.

Every semester we fight over how to pay for my college and books. Because of their high income, financial aid isn't available. I failed most of last year because I worked too much and often couldn't make it to class, and now that I'm down to part time it's manageable. But also because of last year my GPA tanked and I'm not eligible for GPA-based financial aid either. My intention is to leave community college after the fall 2017 semester (with a healthy GPA) and start at the state school for a botany major and math minor, and graduate to find a full time job that would support both monthly loan payments and living expenses (i.e. not with my parents). 

Given how much student loan debt I currently have and how much CC debt my father is currently in, would it be better for me to drop out of school entirely? I have no major skill set and do not live near enough to any city, so finding a full time job would be limited to call centers and maybe secretary work. If I were to drop out I would probably never be able to start college again with all the debt I am in, and at the age of 23 I already feel too old to be this far behind.

The other option was to refinance my student loans through a third party with a lower interest rate, however this would end my deferment completely and require I start making payments immediately. I do not want to live with my parents past 26, our relationship has become strained enough by me living here again, and if I were forced into paying back loans immediately then I would not be able to afford moving out. 

The final option is to take out more loans. I will have to when I get to state school without a doubt, and most of it should be covered until the subsidized and unsubsidized loans, but I had wanted to put off taking more out until I'm at a real college. This all has to get paid back, and the less I have to pay later the better! Which is why I've been trying to make small payments now to take the edge off the final amount.

Which route do I take? My parents did not attend college so they don't understand how important it is for me to graduate, and they favor the first option of dropping out to get a full time job and living with them until I'm 30. Honestly I'd rather die than go down that path, I do eventually want to have a life outside of work and school, but if there's more agreement towards that then I would put more thought into it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ki0su/is_it_more_financially_responsible_for_me_to_drop/,1482815852

"Money order stolen from apartment offfice, facing eviction","This month we paid our $950 rent with a money order the same way we have for the last 3 years we've lived in this apartment. Because my girlfriend and I both work crazy hours we've always dropped an envelope with the rent in the drop box attached directly to the office. Never had a problem before.

So this month we drop it in after work one night and think nothing else of it. Until a week later when we get a phone call from the office saying they haven't received it yet. We tell them we put it in the box and ask if they could check everything again. The next day still nothing, but they seem like they're willing to work with us in figuring out what happened.

Next day, we manage to find the receipt stub for the money order and call to find out its been cashed that day. We call the office again and their response is that they don't have it and our rent is now late, so the next step is for them to seek an attorney to serve us an eviction notice. Girlfriend goes into panic mode but we're both pretty sure it's an office worker who stole it. At most 5 people could have access to the locked box. So we make a police report that same day and that's pretty much where it stands right now. 

Western union states it'll take up to 30 days to get a copy of the money order. The office is saying they will serve the eviction if we don't pay another $950 right away.

And yes I know a check would be much better but she was paying with money orders before I moved in here with her and like I said, no issues or complaints about this place at all till now. Going forward obviously we'll be much more diligent about the whole process. I know we can't prove we even put it in without a receipt from the office which we don't get using the box.

How to Negotiate Annual Raises in Large Corporation?,"Hi r/personalfinance

I work for a multi-billion dollar company with decent benefits, a great pension, and a fair amount of room for career advancement. 



Every January, we receive a wage increase, based on my manager's review of my performance. I consistently am rated high (second from top rating).  Last year, I was very disappointed by my raise. It was around 2.7%. Given my life stage with multiple children, this was below my effective inflation rate. So I was now working a job that had evolved to a more complex job, and I was earning less money after inflation. 



I talked to my direct manager at the time, who told me the raise is automatic and not negotiable. I discretely talked to my group manager after that (her boss), who actually laughed at me for even asking to negotiate the raise higher. 



This year, I was again rated high, and with the exact same rating was given a raise of 2.1%.



This doesn't cover even two thirds of my expected increases in cost of living for 2017.



I am convinced that there is a way to negotiate this, but I don't believe my direct manager is the one with the authority to increase my pay.

Parents giving me investment properties as they retire?,"Hello Reddit!

They currently have a property management company maintaining the properties, and both properties are currently being rented out. I currently have a stable job, have plenty of disposable income, and no debt.


They want to give me the two investment properties when they retire, which is great because I also want to start investing in real estate. However, I have a bunch of questions:


1- What is the best way to ""get the properties"" while reducing taxes for both myself and my parents?


2- I heard that it is a good idea to start a company, and then put the properties under the company (as this dodges liability, you can claim expenses as write offs, etc). What is the best way to ""start a company""? Is there a specific state this company should be registered under? How do I put the properties ""under the company""?


3- Should I get a lawyer or accountant to look into this? Is there a specific type of lawyer/accountant I should look for? How much should I expect to pay for the services I'm looking for?


4- Do you have any other tips/info for me?

My buddy just called me, he's in North Carolina and got a DUI and crashed into some property(said the damage was probably in $100k+, the house was vacant though).


Basically he obviously fucked up really bad and his whole future is in jeopardy. He doesn't have a degree, was working for federal govt(but thats probably gone), and his career in federal government is probably over as far as I know.


What exactly are his options? He doesn't have a degree, hes probably out of a job, I looked up expungement laws for NC(He lives in Wisconsin but the DUI happened in NC), and it says it has to be 15 years later. He definitely does not have the money right now to pay that much money, so he may go to jail.



Hes honestly one of the best people I know and I'm a very cynical person. I really believe he has the drive to get through this someday, he obviously fucked up but hes one of the few people I know that I would vouch for and say his life isn't over.



He has a lawyer, obviously I know my place, I'm honestly just trying to find some comforting things to say so that he doesn't feel 100% fucked, as hes still pretty young. Obviously hes gonna have to pay a lot of money out and it closes a lot of doors, but I figure one day after a long time he can be successful again.

I get the ""pay"" option for my online banking pretty much the moment I use my CC.  Do I pay it off that same day? I've been told that paying it off too early can slow the growth of my credit score because it'd think my utilization was low, or something along those lines?  Maybe I misunderstood.

(US/JP) Paypal is unfairly withholding my funds for medical school tuition from me. What can I do?,"Here's the situation: I'm a medical student studying in Japan, and moved here a couple of years ago from America. My parents wanted to send me some money to help with tuition and living expenses, so I set up a Japanese PayPal account to transfer funds between my Japanese and American bank accounts. 

After verifying my Japanese PayPal and getting it fully activated, I tried to send the money my parents gave me (about $7000) from my US account to my Japanese one on October 26th. According to PayPal, it takes about 3-5 business days to process an international e-check transaction, which was no problem. However, after that time passed and the transaction cleared from my bank account, it still remained ""pending"" on my PayPal account, with the money not showing in the remaining balance on either side. I called them asking about it, and they said for Japanese transactions it can take up to 10 business days. As you probably guessed, that time passed as well with no status change. I called my US bank, and they said there wasn't much they could do because the funds had already cleared from my bank account. I thought PayPal may have put a hold on it for risk assessment ([as they explain in their TOS here] (https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full#holds-limitations)), but they never notified me about it and as such it would be a breach of their TOS if it were in fact a hold.

And so, I called PayPal again last week (now over a month since the original transaction should have gone through), and they said it was ""an I.T. issue"", and that they ""have escalated it and are looking into it"", but wouldn't give me a time frame for when it would be resolved.

Now, it's been over two weeks since my tuition for this semester was due, and I don't have enough to cover it without those funds. I've contacted the financial office at my university, and they were very understanding and didn't assess any late fees; however, they did say it could affect my ability to register for class next term if it isn't paid by then.

So, my question is, if PayPal doesn't resolve this quickly, what should I do? Does anyone else have any experience with this kind of thing?

#TL;DR: PayPal is wrongly holding/seems to have lost my money for tuition, and it could screw me over for my next semester in medical school. What should I do?

[20M] Credit building very slow?,"Hi /pf, I've been browsing for a bit now and had my own question. I started building my credit a bit over a year ago when my mom co-signed for me to get a car. 6 months after that I got a capital one quicksilver card with a $300 limit. I was using quite a bit of its limit for the cashback reward(realized what credit utilization was recently and stopped doing that) at the start but now use it rarely to keep low utilization.

 I've been checking my credit frequently and trying to find ways to build my credit for fun and to help myself out later but my credit has been building very slowly the last few months(only a couple points a month.) I'm currently at 684 and want to figure out my next step. I'm thinking the obvious choice is the apply for another credit card but with only having my one card for ~6-7 months now, as well as not making a ton of money (~17k a year after tax) I don't know if its worth trying to apply for one with a low income and new credit and possibly getting declined and the hard pull going onto my report..

"About to graduate college, want to get rich someday. I want to come up with a long-term strategy.","Hello /r/personalfinance,

I'm about to graduate college (one semester to go) and I want to get really rich someday. I want to draft a long-term plan for my finances, something that leads me along the path to the riches. However, I've been getting conflicting advice from multiple people.

Some of them says getting stable well-paying jobs (I have pretty good grades), being frugal, and steadily investing is the way to go. Some of them says entrepreneurship is the way to go.

In terms of my *expected* (i.e. in a statistical sense) *future value of my assets at year 2046 measured in 2016 dollars*, which one is the better way to get rich? Considering (1) high probability of failure in startups, &amp; (2) that I have to slowly climb up the career ladder if I choose stable jobs.

I don't need an exact number-vs-number comparison, that's impossible to figure out, but I'm happy to accept any relevant numbers/statistics. Does anyone have the statistics for entrepreneurship vs stable jobs? Ballpark figures?

(It's pretty hard to get unbiased answers for this questions. Many articles I get by googling writes very strongly and passionately for entrepreneurship, and I smell bias; while other articles writes on and on about compounding, something that I already know. Please help.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jcd1p/about_to_graduate_college_want_to_get_rich/,1482225491
Recently Married: Have Tax &amp; Health Insurance Questions,"Hello-

Recently married this past month. We've been together 5+ years, and have already largely merged our finances where applicable. We also had a pretty in-depth prenuptial agreement made, which forced us to sort out most of our shared and separate assets months ago. 

The questions I had were related to Tax Returns and Health Insurance. 

We're both actively employed, but I work in a more traditional industry while my wife works in tech/start-up. We felt it'd make sense to carry with my insurance vs carrying separately, and that this would allow her to change jobs without concern for losing coverage. We both work and reside in California. 

When I initiated the life-change with Mercer, my benefits facilitator, it asked if healthcare was an available option with my wife's employer, which I had indicated that it was. As a result of selecting this, there was a fee assessed in the monthly billing that would occur if we were to be covered under my employer's plan that almost doubled my monthly liability. 

Question: Am I selecting or reviewing something incorrectly? Is it not more beneficial for us to ride under one or the other's insurance, vs carrying separate coverage with our employers? If that assumption is correct, has it changed under ACA? 

Regarding taxes, I've started to prep our tax filing for CY2016. In the very-rough scenario, our separate filings would result in $2k-$3k returns for us each. When filing jointly, we end up owing about $4,500. We both have 0 withholdings and earn about $120K each. 

Question: should we not filing as jointly in CY2016? Is there an alternative filing or tax benefit now that we're married that I'm missing? 

Any other tax or insurance items that we might be missing now that we're married? 

Thanks-",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kw444/recently_married_have_tax_health_insurance/,1483005902

Have I been paying off my credit cards improperly for years?,"I'm freaking out because I just read up on a random article about statement closing dates and utilization rates and now I'm extremely confused.

I have 2 credit cards, let's call them Card A and Card B.

Card A

* $4,000 limit.
* Next payment due date is Jan 4, 2017. It's almost always around the 4th.

Card B

* $1,000 limit.
* Next payment due date is Jan 1, 2017. It's almost always around the 1st.

Now, here's how I use my cards:

- I usually use about 80-95% of my limit on both cards. This is because it's easier and safer for me than using my debit card.
- I've never once considered the statement closing date for either card. I've only ever paid attention to the ""Payment due"" date in my online account.
- I always pay off the entire balance in full, every time. I've never missed a payment.
- I always make the payments about 1-2 days before each card's ""payment due date"".

Am I doing this right? I've been doing this for YEARS. I believe CreditKarma put my score around ~730, so now I'm wondering if this is worse than it could be, or what.

Should I actually be paying off the cards at some other date? Is there a chance that I've been paying too early, or too late, and that they've been reporting a balance to the credit bureaus? If so, when the hell SHOULD I pay off these cards? I've scoured every inch of my statements for both cards, and I cannot find any other statement closing date for me to base this decision on.

Also, should I really be using only 30% of my limit? This would make my life incredibly more complex. I'd have to get even more credit cards and micro-manage purchases across all of them. Eeeegggh.

"Company bypassed ""verified by visa""","Hi, 
Let me start of by saying that I am based in Europe.

Yesterday I was looking at flight tickets, I had pretty much set my mind and went through the booking process. Last second I changed my mind and decided to book something else, I had just received my ""verified by VISA"" text and the page was prompting me for the one time code. As I had changed my mind I did not enter the code and just left the page.

Fast forward 10 minutes and to my surprise I get a booking confirmation... I call my bank to question how a company was able to charge my debit card despite me not authorizing it with the code that is supposedly there to protect me. The answer was ""call the company and ask them"".

My main concern here is that the company in question do not have any proper email support system and calling them is 1 euro per minute - and I don't see this being a short call. To add to the mess I am currently abroad for 3 more weeks.

1) how did the company bypass verified by visa? 
2) can I just file a chargeback based on that fact alone? 
3) is there any time limit for how long I can wait to request the chargeback? Calling my bank from here is not free and I have very limited time.
4) can I demand that my bank sorts out contacting the company? 

It's not a whole lot of money but it's 200 euros I'd rather spend on something rather then losing (I can't travel on the dates).

"I'm out of debt, which isn't great for my credit . Is a credit card worth it?","I've never been one to go into debt easily, or at all, if I can save up and pay cash. I've been rather fortunate in that my parents taught me budgeting from a very young age and explained early on how dangerous credit cards can be if you're irresponsible (very David Ramsey-ish). 
So, I have paid off all my debt and have been living debt free for the past 4 years (had a few thousand in student loans and paid off a car, but never went into any their kind of debt). I've never owned a credit card, and don't own any property (so no mortgage). 

Here is the thing: my credit score is only fair because I don't have enough debt. I have identity theft protection which also shows my credit score, and the reason my score is fair (but not excellent) is: 

Score Reasons

- No open accounts in your credit file
- Lack of sufficient relevant real estate account information
- Lack of sufficient relevant bankcard or revolving account information

I don't plan on ever buying a house, but if I did want to make a large purchase in life and needed to have a good credit score (like upgrading my car in a few years), is it worth getting a credit card and going into debt to build credit? At this point, i know I don't qualify for certain credit cards (like Capital One Venture), but should I get a ""credit-building"" card just until my score goes up?

Not sure if I should accept job offer,"Hello Reddit, 

I'm in the staffing and recruiting industry. I recently left my job as a branch manager because the stress was too much. It was an absolutely appalling company, and their business practices were shady. I left mid-Nov. with no backup plan. In mid-December, I accepted a work-from-home recruitment consulting position. I've since been offered a position as a hospitality recruiter position with a what seems like a great franchise. The franchise location is a brand new.  The position is 100% commission based, but I receive a monthly stipend that's deducted from my commission checks.  They do offer benefits but no 401K. I have two major concerns: 

1) Since it's a commission based role, there's no ""paid"" time off. The owner said he's very flexible and I can take whatever time I need and still receive a full stipend. However, since I wouldn't be working and closing deals for the time that I take off, it might impact my sales for that quarter. 
2) I'm 28 years old, and I'm afraid that if I take this position and it's not the right fit, I'm hurting my career trajectory. I only stayed with the shady company for 6 months; prior to that, I was with one company for 3 years but seeing no growth in my career. 

Wondering whether I should accept the job or wait until I find a position that is for sure the right fit.

"Moved out in August, haven't heard from Landlord since. Still paying rent and have not been returned deposit. Any suggestions?","Hi all,

This is in Cleveland. My wife got an amazing job offer in late July that would bring us to Seattle. We talked to our landlord about breaking the lease and since nothing was in the lease agreement about doing so (he is just a dude that owns it and the lease agreement was off a website that didn't cover it) and he was not happy. He had two other properties he was working on and didn't want to update ours to re-rent. He told me he didn't think he'd get around to it until December. Both my wife and I were upset because as far as we know, the landlord must make every effort immediately to rent out the place immediately. 

Long story short I suppose: we've sent 3 certified letters since then asking for the steps he has taken to rent out the place as well as asking for our deposit. We have not received anything or any communication from him about this. Meanwhile, we are continuing paying rent to him. We have one more month until our lease is done.

We thought about small claims court but the max that can be awarded is $3k and since we are across the country we would not gain much money. And if we had a lawyer represent us (which you can do in Ohio small claims apparently) that would eat even more into it.Flying out and getting travel accommodations would also be very expensive. We really don't want to pay the last month's rent at all. He finally posted the place for rent mid November but haven't heard if he rented it out yet. I am concerned that someone might be living there and he is keeping double rent. Or he has no intention of renting it out until the lease is done. 

Do you guys have any suggestions on what I can or should do? This has been such a terrible experience and would love to remedy it. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5gm9ec/moved_out_in_august_havent_heard_from_landlord/,1480949316

Question about Derogatory accounts on credit report,"Hey /r/personalfinance,

I was wondering if anyone could provide some guidance on removing Derogatory marks from my credit report? I'm being held hostage in terms of credit limit/loans because these are reported and reflected in my credit score and report. The balances for these are all $0 and were paid off over two years ago, but they remain like a black mark (up to 7 years?). 

All together these three marks didn't even equal up to $700, not that it matters, but I wasn't massively in debt or anything. I paid them off as soon as I was aware of them but they're still holding me back.

I have two credit cards and an auto loan and I've never missed a payment since I opened these accounts. These derogatory marks are before I even started building good credit, so I've been working myself out of a hole since I started.

I'm planning on buying a house in 2017, but I don't want to even go for a home loan until I've resolved this. 

Has anyone had any success getting these removed? I've read a couple different articles but they all suggested I should've negotiated with the credit agencies to remove the reports before I paid off anything. Unfortunately that ship has sailed.

Trying to plan my post-graduation years as a pharmacist wanting to move,"So I'm going to pharmacy school at a private school in the midwest. Sooo student loans out the wazoo (6 years x $50k/year). My parents make decent money so I don't really get any government help besides the usual federal loans, and the loans are all in my name. So basically I'll graduate with tons of debt, but I'll make good money as a pharmacist.  I want to move to somewhere in Los Angeles. My mom says I should stay home after I graduate for a few years just to save money and work on my debt. Pharmacists here make ~$120k/yr, but I think it's a little more in LA.  I just feel like it will be hard to leave once I take a job here and have been here a few years. Would I be safe accepting a job in LA immediately after graduation? I have some family out there and my grandma has 2 extra bedrooms. I'm thinking I'll ask to stay with her for a month or so while I find a place to live. My last year is rotations and I'll have a month off, so that's when I want to visit out there and apply for jobs like crazy. What do you all think of my plan? Is it feasible? What do you recommend? Thanks!

Edit: So I'm gay and I've visited there before and fell in love with it. I think I'd have more of a chance to find love out there than in the Midwest. Also if I did find love here it would be hard convincing them to move. I don't want to buy a home, just rent for now at least, and Zillow shows some decent options for 1br apartments for ~$1200/mo but I would try and get a 2br with a roommate to make it cheaper. My aunt lives in Long Beach which is very nice and my grandma lives in Huntington Beach.

Boss only started payroll this month - no paystubs before or withholding.,"Started working as a ""salaried"" worker back in May (was originally an independent contractor for a trial period starting in Jan), but my boss paid me the full amount in check form (even though I submitted a W-4.) 

My boss said he'd set up everything, but a month went by, two months went by, and I kept on getting paid by check in the full amount with no paystub, no withholding. (I realize that this is a red flag...)

After much prodding was able to get my first paystub with proper deductions for November. 

My question is, how do I fix everything retroactively? The current payroll software they're using treats November as my first month, and I'm concerned that they're not going to send a proper W-2. 

Is there any way that I can protect myself?

Edit: I'm also a bit confused about the California minimum salary thing. My boss says that because we only have 4 employees, we're exempt from that. Also, I have a coworker who's a 1099 independent contractor and gets paid on an hourly basis, but from all our research seems like he should be an employee. My boss also refuses to pay overtime to said coworker for working over 40 hours a week.

Best X-mas Present: Student Loans Finished!!,"Hey guys. Never posted here before, but I just hit a milestone I wanted to share. Not nearly as good or as fast as some of you crazy PFers, but I just paid off the final remnants of my student loans about 2 minutes ago. $67,000 in principal, just under 3 years. I could have been more diligent with spending - who among us couldn't? - but I always set aside a big chunk for monthly payments, and I benefitted from a few lump sums along the way (larger than expected bonuses, one surprise). My wife has about 3k remaining on her loans (originally $45k 2 years ago), which we should be able to kill in its entirely next month.

Having a side job definitely helped, and 80-90% of post-tax side job earnings went right on the student loan pyre. We both have Roth IRAs (not maxing just yet, but we will resume doing so immediately) and are at 8% with decent matches on our 401ks. Besides upping those two contributions, I don't REALLY know how best to plan for saving our newly freed-up chunk of $$, but reading this sub has helped me immensely, and I plan on digging in quite a bit more to plan for the next few years. Thanks y'all, Happy Holidays / Merry Xmas / Happy New Year!

EDIT: (For anyone still reading!) Asked my wife last night about her loan total at graduation, and she corrected me - it was $35k, not $45k. So just about $100k combined. Sorry for the overestimate!

"Wire transfer lieu, unable to locate whereabouts","The automated help line for the bank is of little use in this matter and we(my wife and I) don't live in the same state as the branch we originally opened the account with, 10yrs ago.

In summary, I don't have an account in my name, so everything goes through her (wife's) BoA account as far as my paychecks and household bill payments.

I was asked for the acct and routing info from my employer's accountant (I'm on a w9) and gave the account number and routing number listed as standard on the account information page. The payee also listed my name as the beneficiary on the account, which I haven't had an issue with in past transfers.

I'm assuming the discrepancy on the routing number must be part of the issue. The payment is not an ach from a domestic bank, it is a wire transfer from a foreign bank. We gave them the Swift code but I wasn't aware there was a dedicated routing number for wire transfers, separate from ach transfers.

So it's been 4 business days now and their bank confirms that the funds have been pulled from their account and sent put. BoA's automated helpline tells my wife that there isn't a pending transfer showing on our end.

I've never messed up a transfer to this degree before, so I'm unclear as to how much work we need to do on our end versus the payee can do on their end, to talk to the person able to locate the whereabouts of the money and correct the information so it can be directed appropriately.

Starting College Fund for Goddaughter - 529 or Roth IRA?,"So my close friend just had a little bundle of joy dropped off at his doorstep, and asked me to be her godfather. 

My friend isn't too terribly financially stable, so I figured that the best thing to do for my new goddaughter is to start a College Fund for her. 

[The Wiki mentions the difference between a typical 529 savings plan and a Roth IRA,](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/3-reasons-to-use-a-roth-ira-to-save-for-college-2015-03-25) but it seems a little light on details and maybe skewed to the Roth IRA side ever so slightly.

The 529 can only be used for educational payment options (heavily penalized for non-education payments) and seems very ""hands off/fire and forget,"" but what are the downsides of using a Roth IRA for a college fund, and the limitations of the 529?

Key Points, if it matters:

* I currently live in Illinois, my friend and goddaughter are in Nevada.

* Gainfully employed for 2+ years.

* No significant debt to my name. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jegjf/starting_college_fund_for_goddaughter_529_or_roth/,1482254585

Deleted collection suddenly re-appeared on my credit report. What do I do?,"A couple years ago, while checking my credit reports I noticed a medical debt in collections from 2011. I disputed it online via all the credit bureaus, and it was deleted from my reports. Sometime within the past month, it suddenly popped up again. I disputed it again, but Experian has already reported back that it is ""Updated"" which means they're not deleting it. 

I called the collection agency, and she immediately offered to delete it if I paid in full. I asked for more information on the debt, wrote down what she had, and said I'd call back - I never admitted it was mine or said I would pay. 

Like I said, the debt is from a medical lab bill in 2011. I don't know how to look into it because my insurance has changed (multiple times) since then. I was definitely insured though and I find it hard to believe that routine labs (it must have been, or I would remember) ran me $400 with insurance. Or, there's also a possibility the debt is not actually mine at all. 

Did this agency commit a FCRA violation by not contacting me by either phone or mail? I never heard from them, but my address and phone number have changed since 2011 (not sure if that matters). It's also possible they contacted me when they originally reported the debt (2013?) - would they have been legally obligated to contact again when they re-submitted it to the credit bureaus?

I want to get this off my score ASAP since I intend to buy a house within the next six months. My report says it won't drop off until March 2018. I could afford to ""pay for delete"" but I don't know what the debt was for, why I owe it, why it's suddenly re-surfaced, etc.

Negotiating a raise - social media manager,"I've looked at some other threads about getting a raise, but I wanted some advice specific to my situation.

1. I'm a marketing associate/social media manager at a very small travel agency (10 employees) in Chicago that caters to the luxury market. I make $14/hour. I'm the only person here who isn't a travel agent, so everyone else gets a salary (not sure how much) and commission. Also, I'm technically an ""independent contractor"" so even though I'm full time, I don't get benefits and can't work overtime.
2. I JUST graduated college (edit: but have 3 years of paid writing and editing experience, plus related internships) and have been working here less than a year. I'm not planning to ask for a raise until I have been working here a year, but am trying to prepare early.
3. My daily duties include social media management—strategizing, writing, designing all of the content—as well as designing digital ads, creating fliers for events, and website content management. I've also undertaken some very large projects, basically editing every single travel package on the website, which is close to 200 packages, because the grammar on them is HORRENDOUS and much of this content needs a complete overhaul.
4. Though I've worked here a short time, the numbers already indicate that I've significantly increased website traffic from social media outlets.
5. I don't want to leave this job. I love the office culture and the work itself. But, I need more money.

To start with, I'm not sure whether I should negotiate for higher hourly pay or negotiate for a salary. According to a few sources, the median salary for this job is $35-40k (although I'm not sure if that accounts for company size) and I'm making more like $20k, which in Chicago is pretty damn low. If I can get a pay raise without benefits, I'd be willing to stick around and negotiate for more down the road.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5g4fdd/negotiating_a_raise_social_media_manager/,1480698917

I just don't know what to do anymore. After 3 years at college I began working in the field of my study, Media. But 6 months later my boss moved offices and I was left without a job. Unfortunately I was only an intern and he was 100% within his right to just let me go so I had no choice but to get whatever work I could find.

Her parents don't like me/wont let me stay with them and im 100% sure if I cant get my side of the rent by end of the month me and her are over as its what she keeps telling me day in day out.

Trying to decide if buying a condo is a good decision,"Little backstory, I'm 22 and recently graduated in May.  I currently have ~$9,500 in my checking and ~$9,500 in my savings account.  I currently make approximately $41k a year but will soon be getting a raise and will be somewhere between $47k - $52k a year beginning in January.  Since I am living at home currently I pay no rent and save most of my money since my only costs are gas and whenever I decide to go out with friends.

This brings me to the title in question.  I recently started looking around at apartments to which surprised me that my monthly note would be lower if I bought compared to renting.  After I mentioned it to my dad, he explained how he believes owning is better than renting, and thinks it is a good idea to look into some places in a couple months and buying if a find the right one.  He also said he would give me $10-$15,000 to help me out if I wanted it.  

So I've been looking around and have found some places ranging from $110 - $140k that are nice and in good areas.   My mother thinks it is dumb and the earliest I should even begin to look is around June/July, while my dad thinks earlier is better since interest rates are currently rising.    I was thinking I could save up a little more and start looking around February/March and maybe by April pull the trigger.

After trying to estimate a monthly expense budget if I would move out, I kept getting around $2000 in expenses a month, which would leave me with $500-$850 leftover at end of the month.  This is including me contributing 4% to my 401k for full match and $50 a week I put in savings (low I know, but  since I had over $9,000 in savings I figured I didn't need to put much more).

Oh and I plan on staying at this location for 5+ years and possibly 10 if that makes a difference.  I also thought if/when I move I could rent it out (I understand the risks)

I know kind of long winded but was hoping to hear some opinions and get advice.  I looked on sidebar and searched previously but was hoping to get some specifics with my situation. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5hs9aw/trying_to_decide_if_buying_a_condo_is_a_good/,1481488912
Option to move to save a ton on rent- is it worth it?,"I moved from the midwest to an expensive east coast city about a year ago. I've been out of school and earning a ""real"" salary for about 2 1/2 years now (I'm mid-twenties). My take-home pay (after heath care, retirement, etc.) with two bi-weekly paychecks is about $3,680. My housing search was constrained by the fact that I had to find a place during one weekend trip to the east coast, but I managed to find a pretty nice townhouse for $2,425 a month. It is sort of a gem considering the great shape it is in. The landlord is good and it is well kept up, the commute is decent and a lot is within walking distance, the utilities are low, it is really more space than I need, and my only real complaint is one set of neighbors which can occasionally be loud. And- the price. I'm paying 2/3 of my take home pay in rent. I keep my other expenses low (which means I'm not able to travel like I want to), but I'm okay with that as long as it is temporary. I am able to save $100-$400 a month.

I know that the amount I am paying in rent is not great, but I am picky about a few things. I am not willing to live in an apartment with lots of neighbors, I want a comfortable place to be able to work at home some days, and I like to be close to things to walk to and close to the metro/train so I can get to work easily. I can find places that sacrifice a few features and save $100-$300 a month, but moving to a similar place doesn't seem worth the trouble for the small amount of savings.

I really don't want to be renting forever. Mainly, I would like to have a house with my own four walls, the stability that comes from owning a house, and the freedom to make the house my own. But, my present savings and income would only allow me to buy a condo or small townhouse in a less ideal area, and that does not seem much of an improvement over renting a better place like I currently have. My hope is within the next 1-3 years, I will be promoted at work (with a $15k salary increase), and the salary increase will put me in the option to buy a house (about $500k). My current savings (about $50k) could use some improvement to keep future mortgage payments lower.

So, I have two options:

1) I can stay here (my rent should not increase) and eventually my income increase will make the price comfortable. I will have a very small income increase every year, then a larger one when I get the promotion-which could be anywhere from 8 months to 3 years. I would not be able to save a lot towards buying a home and I would need to keep my expenses low until my salary increased.

2) I found another gem: a friend's contact is renting out the lower level of her house for $900 a month (including utilities). There is not a lot within walking distance, but it is just blocks from the the metro/train (so it would be easy to get into the center of the city). The owner is a very sweet retired woman, and is very willing accommodate me to make me comfortable there (for example, there was furniture I could chose to keep there or she could move, she got a fridge so I would have my own, etc.). It is over 800 sq/ft, with a separate bedroom and large bathroom- my college apartment was smaller than that. I would be sharing laundry facilities (on my level) and the kitchen (upstairs, but I would have a fridge and microwave myself). The area was recently remodeled and is in really good shape. There are a few small windows, but not a ton of natural light. I would have to get a storage unit for some of my stuff, and change my address and all the other stuff that comes with moving. But, I would save about $1,400 a month.

So, personal finance, what would you decide?

edit: I signed a 10 month lease for the house share, and I will be able to put down a much larger down payment by next year! Whether my salary increases or not, it will go a long way.

"Buying a house in California, Bay Area?","Hi personalfinance, I was hoping to get some advice from people who know a thing or two about the market in the bay area. 

My significant other and I have been discussing settling down in the bay area for some time now and is leaning towards pulling the trigger in the next year or two. 

The thing is, I was really into the idea in the beginning, but now I am having reservations on whether our combined incomes are actually enough to ""survive"" in the bay area. I work in the city and have a steady (underestimating) 100k/year before taxes, and my SO, who works in Oakland, has a steady (underestimating) 50k/year before taxes. And I have a down payment savings of 100k ready if we decide to jump in. 
We both first time home buyers with $0 outstanding debt. So the mortgage would be the only things against our names aside form the the monthly credit card bill which we are both very good at clearing. 

We know the housing in the bay area is outrageous, and we are not totally opposed to uprooting, but we are strongly against it because of the anchors we have here; family, friends, solid career paths, etc. (we both agree that moving somewhere to start something is a totally different story than moving away from something to uncertainty.) 

However, there are a few bumps that limit our more ""affordable"" options. My significant other has issues with &gt;30 minute commutes and traffic (I work off hours so traffic is not a problem). I have issues with areas of increased crime rates (I was raised in an area with a high crime rate most my life and experienced multiple traumatizing break-ins as a child). And we both would prefer a single family detached home because of our bad experiences with shared walls (apartments, condos, etc.) 

**My question is,** at this point, given our funding, is it at all responsible to even remotely consider taking on a mortgage? Or is renting and never having a place to call ""ours"" the only reasonable option?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kasb1/buying_a_house_in_california_bay_area/,1482708896
New York State Overtime Questions,"I recently moved to New York and I work for a private employer. Small company - only 5 employees. I like what I do but I'm concerned about what I was told from the owners about overtime.

I'm an hourly employee, and they told me I can work over 40 hours but any time over 40 hours will be ""put into a bank of time that I can use later"", meaning taking time off from work if I have an appointment or something. They also said they don't pay overtime unless it's approved overtime, which is never. There isn't an official employee handbook, and I work probably close to 55+ hours a week, so I'm in the dark about this.

"If you never had to borrow money again, would you care about your credit?","In my dad’s last few years of life — house paid off, no debts, pension and retirement accounts keeping him comfortable — I noticed more than once he’d left a bill or two go for several months, paying when it was convenient to him, ignoring the late fees, and not caring a whit when I reminded him it’d start showing late payments on his credit report. 

By the time he died, I’ve got no doubt his credit score was probably tanked, but it truly didn’t seem to bother him. He’d quickly pay guys who he knew needed the money to operate (yard guy, plumber, etc.) and let those he figured didn’t (random not-covered hospital fees, canceled cell phone) wait until it wouldn’t put him out to pay it.

I’ve always, *always* thought about my credit score. If you knew you’d (probably) never have to borrow money again, would you be able to not sweat it like that?

Paying off debt vs Saving,"So I recently got out of a pretty irresponsible relationship that consisted of a lot of needless spending. I am now single, and looking to try to be more responsible with my spending. I have a second job 4 days a month, and I average about $400 a month. My goal is to be able to make a down payment on a house within 4 years on my own. Would I be better off putting that $400 toward my credit cards, and/or car payments? Or would it be better to maybe pay a little extra on them while also saving? Just looking for some advice on what the best course of action would be to achieve my goal. Thank you in advance.



edit : I just want to thank everybody for taking the time to give me some advice. It is greatly appreciated! It seems that there are some different opinions on whether I should begin saving now vs. paying off my credit card debt. I think I am going to begin paying off my credit card debt for the first few months, and then once that is down to around 40-50% I will begin to put some away in an emergency fund. I will probably be back to check in sometime in the near future to ask for more advice on some investment options.

Considering using a Roth 401k for the first year of employment - good idea?,"I'm graduating college in May, and have already accepted an offer (starting late summer 2017) for a position which will put me squarely in the 28% marginal tax bracket.  Because I'll likely be in a lower bracket in retirement, I believe that a traditional 401k will be the best choice for me long-term.  However, because I'm starting in the middle of 2017, I'll only be earning income for about half of the year, so my annual gross income for 2017 will be substantially lower - about 80k.

I'm not sure if a traditional or Roth 401k is right for me in 2017.  Retirement is far away for me, so I'm very interested in tax diversification.

I believe that a Roth IRA is the easy choice for 2017, because I won't qualify for the tax deduction from a traditional IRA, but will still be able to contribute to a Roth IRA.  I'll be ineligible to contribute to a Roth IRA (unless I use a backdoor Roth) in 2018, so I think it's wise to contribute to it now.

In 2018, I'll definitely be contributing to a traditional 401k for the tax deduction, but I think it might make sense to take advantage of my (relatively) lower income in 2017 to contribute to a Roth 401k while in the 25% marginal tax bracket.  Even if my income in retirement is slightly lower than my 2017 income, (which it very well might not be) I think that maxing the Roth 401k now makes sense for tax diversification, if nothing else.  Am I thinking about this plan the right way?  Is there something I'm not considering?

I'm not sure if it's significant to the decision, but the company's 401k has failed discrimination testing for the last several years, so I likely won't be able to max my 401k contributions, or use a Mega Backdoor Roth, even though the 401k plan does allow for after-tax contributions.  I will be attempting to max both my 401k and IRA, but will likely get a refund for some of the 401k contributions.  I will also be contributing to a taxable account.  All accounts (IRA, 401k, and taxable) are with Vanguard.

Any thoughts?  Does this plan seem reasonable?  I'm still pretty new to all of this, so I want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly.  Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5h1n7n/considering_using_a_roth_401k_for_the_first_year/,1481136111
Ways to boost credit quickly.,"Since I got married a little over a year ago I have been focusing on my credit because I would really love to move out of Apartment life and into a house or townhouse that I own. 

For a quick history, In my early 20's (i'm 37 now) my credit went to crap due to a very expensive art school, living paycheck by paycheck, and basically all around carelessness on bills that I couldn't afford. Thankfully I got myself back on track as far as student loans go, so as of last month, 2 out of 3 loans are now paid and I expect the 3rd to be paid by the end of this month. Also, thanks to the advise I found browsing this subreddit, I've been using CreditKarma to get on top of my scores, knock out any collections, etc. Currently my TransUnion score is at 704 and Equifax is at 701.

Now for the root of the question. I am wanting to start the house search in Jan or Feb and want to do whatever I can to achieve the highest score before then. I have never had a credit card before. Currently my credit score shows a 1k credit card limit and 25% utilization for a Dell computer I bought on payments that I nearly have paid off as well. I started looking at the Credits Cards offered by my bank (Chase) wondering if I opened one now if it would either effect my credit negativity or positively by this coming Jan or Feb?

Overall I know the CC would help, my initial plan for a CC was just to open one and use it for gas once a month and pay it off. (I really don't like credit cards). If anyone has any advise Id love to hear it! Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5h1pp7/ways_to_boost_credit_quickly/,1481136814
"Retiring at 50 (41 now), unusual plan for retiring, need to know if I've made any errors in my plan!","Long time Reddit reader, but my first post ever!

My wife and I are planning to retire in 9 years, and we need feedback/criticism on our plan, which is a bit unusual.  We're Canadian, both 41, two kids, 10 and 12 years old.  Grew up with no money, paid for our own schooling, been together more than half our lives, and neither of us are spenders.

My wife is a healthcare worker with a defined benefit pension, she will have 24 years of service at age 50, and we are fairly confident that her work pension, plus my government pension, if deferred to 65, will provide $40k/year in income in today's dollars.  We are busy saving to cover the gap in income between ages 50-65.  Assuming $40k spending in today's dollars (which is what we actually spend less kid-related costs, been tracking it for years), plus 2% inflation over next 25 years, my spreadsheet calc says we'll need $830k at age 50.  

Our stats;

$600k paid off house.
$200k in investments, balanced mix of Vanguard ETF's.
Paid off new modest vehicle.  No debt.
$30k in education savings for kids.

Our plan is to grow the $200k to at least $600k over 9 years, which shouldn't be a problem with our current investment mix and savings rate of $40k/year.  Then we'll downsize our house from a $600k house to a $300k house further from the city, to free up $300k in cash needed later, around age 55-60.  We really just want a home base from which to travel from (our travel will mainly be backpacking, bikepacking, and car camp travelling, so quite cheap).

This is Canada, so post-secondary education is much cheaper than U.S., especially if you live at home.  We are commutable distance to at least 6 colleges/universities, so if our kids choose to go this route, the cost shouldn't affect our plans (we expect them to pay at least half).  

The money needed for ages 50-65 will all come from RRSP's (same as Roth-IRA's in U.S., I believe, except in Canada there is no penalty for early withdraw, it just becomes taxable income).  As we'll be equally splitting the withdrawals, the taxes owing will be very low.  Our plan is to hit age 65 with zero in savings.  Our pensions are indexed to inflation and backed by government for life, so we should be fine there.  House is back up plan, could sell if needed. 

Risks;
- stock and/or house markets crash and don't recover before we need money
 - marital/job/health problems (we've been together since teens, have secure incomes, and are very healthy)
- higher inflation than historical norm

Advantages;
- we're very adaptable, we'd be fine living in an RV or boat if funds were tight, or working part time jobs after retiring. 
- we don't hate our jobs, we just prefer to have much more time to  ourselves, so if something goes wrong, we can always work longer without feeling resentment

So what are we missing!?  This all seems too good to be true right now, I feel I must have made a grievous calculation error somewhere, and would prefer to discover it now rather than later.

P.S. - to head off any comments about us missing out on life now, we aren't enduring any hardships to achieve our savings level.  Most of what we enjoy in life is free or cheap, we're outdoor lovers and spend our free time in nature and having dinner parties with friends.  We're careful with our money, but we don't feel we're going without anything important in life

"At what point does the traditional 401(k) do ""more"" for you than the Roth?","Hi guys,

I'm hoping for some input. I keep going back and forth about what to do for this coming year with respect to retirement savings.

I earn a relatively high salary (~$130k). I live in an expensive area (Los Angeles) with high tax rates. I can't afford a house anytime soon, so all I can take is the standard deduction.

I've been maxing out my 401(k) and HSA over my IRA because in my mind, it's better to reduce my taxable income (though my state taxes do not let me deduct the HSA, only the 401(k)). I'm lucky that my 401(k) through my company is through Vanguard and my company picks up the fees. The match is relatively high: 100% match up to 6%, an additional 50% match on another 4% for a total 8% match on a 10% contribution.

I currently do not contribute to my Roth IRA.

Conventional wisdom all my life has been to contribute to the 401(k) up to the match, then max out my Roth IRA + HSA, then go back and max out the 401(k) -- and use a Roth 401(k) instead of traditional. However, since my tax burden is high and my 401(k)  choices are good, my thinking is that I'm hitting the tipping point where opting for a traditional 401(k) and maxing it out before contributing to an IRA makes sense. 

Did I miss some major factor as I stepped through the logic? Is there an additional benefit I do not know of?

Rebalancing for the first time after reading a post about rebalancing. Need a second opinion. 26 years old.,"Lets get to it. I am 26 years old. I want to rebalance my portfolio to this allocation. ( My current allocation is at the end of the post).

CSIBX - 26% (Bonds)
BSPAX- 52% (S&amp;P 500 Index)
CGRNX- 22% (Large Cap Value)

I realize I am missing some international funds, but correct me if I am wrong, but FADIX  our only International fund choice, is not the best one due to expense ratios? Again please please correct me if I'm wrong. And I read that I can make that up by contributing to an international fund via Vanguard IRA. I would also appreciate if anyone can give me their opinion on BSPAX. It is a fairly new fund, but that is the only fund in my account with an expense ratio of under 1%.The last 3 years it did well, but is it safe to rebalance my  52% of my money into it.

I am also thinking about having less bonds. Is this a safe move? My risk tolerance is pretty high. I'm thinking about going 15%. If I do that, would I increase my allocation on S&amp;P fund? Increase the Large Cap? Go for a Mid Cap?

35 yr old with $40k to invest. Trying to pick a portfolio but I'm confused about the benefit of ETF vs mutual funds vs target funds.,"Hi everyone. I'm a 35 year old who is finally comfortable enough to start investing extra cash in stocks. My debts are paid off. I've maxed out my TSP and IRA, and I've got an emergency fund. That still leaves me with $40k just sitting around. I have an Ameritrade account that I'd love to put to good use! 

I've done a lot of reading on the sub and I think a 3 fund portfolio suits me.

(1) Given that I have a TSP account invested in a target fund, does that change how I should be allocating assets in a 3 fund portfolio?

(2) I'm confused about the advantages of a portfolio comprised of mutual funds vs ETFs.  

(3) Would it make more sense to just buy a Vanguard target date fund rather than create my own mix of MF/ETFs?

I would LOVE to hear what you'd do if you were me. I grew up in a financially unstable household and it has made me very motivated to be secure my own finances, but it's also caused me to feel very insecure about making these choices on my own. Thank you!

Should I sell my house for a down payment on another - or keep it is a rental property?,"Hi Everyone. Im 32 years old and in 2010 I bought a townhouse outside of Denver, Colorado for $150K. I have about $110K left in my mortgage and the house could currently sell around $250 - $265. In an ideal world my spouse and I would love to sell the townhouse, and use the money earned for a large down payment on our dream home in the Denver area. But, the housing market in Denver is insane - so we are thinking of selling townhouse while the market is high, rent our current place for another 6 months or so, and see if we can find our dream home and hope the Denver market goes a bit lower, or we get lucky and find a house we love without having to rush. I have been renting my townhouse for enough time that it is now an investment property and I will be hit with capitol gains taxes. So, the other option is to keep renting it, while renting a place downtown - thus, paying off one mortgage by rent, but throwing away money on renting another. Any suggestions? Should we sell now at a high point and use that $100K or so on a down payment for a dream home without an extravagant mortgage. Or, keep renting and being a landlord?

"Sold investment property, what to do with cash?","I had 2 investment homes in Texas.  After a crazy couple of years in our local real estate market, I decided to cash out of one of them.  My net after the sale was $190k.

Here is a quick picture of my finances:  
- $410k cash in the bank (including the $190k above)  
- $275k in 401k  
- $70k in equity on another investment property  
- $330k in loan for my primary residence (about 140k equity, 4% 30yr fixed)  
- My annual household income is $200k  
- I make a paltry pre-tax contribution of 8.5% to 401k (including employer match, combined between wife &amp; I)  
- 35 yo &amp; married with 1 kid (&lt;2yo)  

I have no IRAs, no Roth IRAs, and a nearly empty HSA from a long time ago.

While I was already cash heavy, now I am extremely so.  Given that the real estate market is a bit crazy here, I'm looking to diversify into other investments.  I have 2 real goals atm: college saving &amp; retirement planning.

In terms of college savings, I am putting $600/mo into a regular checking account.

In terms of retirement planning, some calculator told me I need to be closer to 12.5% (with a 70% replacement ratio).  I can bump up 401k contributions; but, I wonder if that's really the best move (I don't know what the fees are -- both wife and I work for small tech companies).

Should I...  
- Pay down my house?  
- Increase my 401k contributions?  
- Put into an IRA annually (and covert to a Roth via the backdoor?)  
- Put the money into a brokerage?  I'm not really the type to want the maintenance of managing stocks.  
- Hold it all in cash and wait for a better time (either for stocks or for real estate)?

Recommended amount to have in savings before switching careers?,"25 year old, getting ready to finish my time in service. I have about 13 months left in and trying to figure out what the next step will be.

My goal is to save $2.5k a month, for a total of $40k+ by the time I get out, but I've been able to put away $3k a month.

"Estranged father took out health insurance policy on me, without telling me. My current health insurance refuses to pay for bill.","In May, I required a hospital trip for an injury and several scans afterwards. My current insurance at the time assured me that they would cover it since it was a medical necessity. 

However, I received phone call from my insurance agency that I have a second policy at another agency and it is that agency's job to pay up for it. I was confused.

I called up the other agency to get information, and I can get none because it requires my father's information to access and I know absolutely none of it. Since I was under 18 when he did it, I need his approval or information to access anything involving this policy. 

Short of hiring a private investigator, I have no information about my father's whereabouts. As of now, the bill is in limbo and I cannot afford to pay it out of pocket. How can I best remedy this situation?

[Other] I need help (Sweepstakes legitimacy),"Today while I was at work, I was called by a number from Denver, Colorado. No voicemail, just a call. I called back when I got out, and got a recording for ""104 The Chain"" saying that I was selected in their trivia sweepstakes for a Complimentary Caribbean Cruise. I played along, the recording asked me three music multiple choice trivia questions which I answered correctly. I was told then to go to thechain104.com and enter my number and once it validated as a winner it would bring me through the process to get my tickets e-mailed to me. 

I know what you all think. SCAM! My first impression as well. But now that I'm looking into it, I'm seeing a lot of reviews and comments on separate websites all saying that they got their tickets. I started a live chat on the radio stations website and talked to one of their representative, no red flags there, everything was as to be expected and it seemed legit. The want you to pay a fee of almost $120 for the tax and port fee, here their exact wording:

""Primary Sailing Passenger must be over the age of 18

$59.89 departure tax and port fee per person

Holiday Cruise Line's passenger ticketing policy requires the departure taxes to be paid before the tickets can be issued into the recipient's name""

I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, do I just have false hope because I won or am I actually a winner? My judgement may be clouded right now, I've never won anything before. 

I'm sure I missed a lot, please ask me anything you need to know.

"Asked Progressive for a repair quote, they made repairs without permission, and are holding the car hostage until we pay","Hello Reddit,

I'll try to keep this as short as possible. My boyfriend's car was hit while he was at work and parked at the side of a rural road. No note, no cameras to catch anything. He filed a police report and a claim with Progressive. The car was taken to a Progressive garage. My boyfriend asked for a quote and told the person he spoke with not to repair anything before giving him the quote and allowing him to approve to the repair. Well, they went ahead and repaired the car anyway and have told my boyfriend that they're sorry that he asked for just a quote, but he needs to pay the $1,000+ or he can't get his car back. Mind you, it was only the side view mirror that needed a repair and that amount sounds very, very expensive to just repair the side view mirror. What are our options? I imagine we probably need to speak with a lawyer? Can we pay out, so we get our car, and still take legal action? Any advice would be appreciated as we're both upset, with this happening so close to the holidays, and don't want to make any rash moves. Thanks!

Edit: The manager of the garage called my boyfriend back this morning and told him we will only have to pay for the mirror as that was what the authorization form was actually referring to and the other repairs were made without proper consent. We're very relieved as we were prepared to pay for the mirror, but not the other repairs that had not been discussed. Also, super happy to be able to get our car back! Thanks for all the advice in this thread! It definitely helped quite a bit. :)

Thank you all for your suggestions and help! I deeply appreciate any help.




BACKGROUND; tmi?:

I have Bipolar II disorder, high functioning autism, an anxiety disorder, and early onset pmr (a pain disorder) and though I really work hard to manage them, I still get occassional bouts of low mania and deep depressions. 

While I consider myself lucky that I have never spent myself into debt, as people under psychosis can often do, I am aware (after the fact) that I sometimes buy thing I don't need (though I think I do at the time) when I'm not quiet right. Though I try to notice when Im becoming ill, sometimes it subtly creeps in.

For these reasons, I've put off getting a credit card, as Im scared that I can't trust myself.

When ill, I have occasionally paid household and doctors bills late. Nothing more than a week or two, but I've heard this will hurt my credit.

Also, because of my illness, I only have a part time job; I make about $1,000 a month. Im working on building my skills so I can get a full time or second part time. I once, when things were really bad, tried to get on Social Security Disability, but was denied because I couldn't give a date of when I became unable to work. About once a year, I have had to take a month or so off work to recover from mental illness or a pmr flare of pain. I've tried to look into short term disability insurance, but it doesnt look like anyone would cover me. Ergo, I try to save a lot during the good times.

 My hubby is an adjunct prof, has good credit, and while we never know how many classes he'll get, we have med/dental  benefits and are pretty secure/live in our means. He does have some college debt ($40k), but the fed government will pay it off in about two years.

I have about $85k in mutual funds from an inheritance from an amazing great grandparent.

I have about $3k in a savings account.

I get anxious and overwhelmed when trying to learn about my personal finance. I find banks and money management scary and I ger anxiety attacks. I kinda shut down and then don't do anything. I hate that I often avoid ooking at my debit card statements, because I know I need to look for discrepancies.

I assumed that because Ive never had a credit card, I don't have a credit history, but perhaps this is just me hoping?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5j2fu5/mental_illness_personal_finance_building_credit/,1482096001
Financing a boat with bad credit,"Good afternoon. I was hoping I could get a little advice here from you guys, maybe even find someone in a similar situation who has done what I'm trying to do. 

Long story short, I make a lot of money and can afford nice things, but due to troubles in the past, I don't have good credit. I want to finance a boat, probably around $30,000 and I was wondering what my options may be. I am the general manager of a car dealership so I have an excellent understanding of finance, what I am asking for, is if there are sub-prime lenders for watercraft, and if so, where can I find them? Are they offered by the dealer, or would I be better off finding my own financing? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jz153/financing_a_boat_with_bad_credit/,1482522948
Selling MDLOX at a loss?,"Back in February 2015, I threw down 20k on MDLOX. At the time I didn't really know much, so, like a noob, I just went to my local bank and heeded their guidance. I didn't really do research (dumb - I know), so I just went along with it since I didn't want to just keep cash lying around. (I was in college at the time.) 

It's been almost two years, and my portfolio is sitting pretty at 18.9k, which is sadly as high as I remember it. (This includes reinvested dividends.) I've essentially been in the red since day one. I'm guessing that's because of the ass-rape front end load of 5.25%? (At the time I didn't know about expenses and stuff - dumb, I know). 

Now, I get the cardinal rule of buy low, sell high, so it seems that I'm doing the opposite in this case, but bear with me. Because of the time value of money, am I better off just dumping it, taking the 1k loss, and just throwing it all into an index fund (VTI)? I'm thinking that, in the long run, I'm better off doing that now as opposed to waiting however long it takes to ""break even"" then cashing out. Also, if and when I plan to sell, will I also be subject to the 1% back end load as well? Do investors pay both the front and back end fees, or is it one or the other? If so, then I'll just have to wait even longer to break even, no?

Does that make sense? Does someone have a better recommendation? Should I just hold onto it indefinitely?

I received the check first (made out to both myself and the village) and immediately deposited into my high (1.05%) interest savings account.  I planned on leaving it there until the taxes were due to make at least a little back in interest.

I received my bill a few days later and found that I have the option to pay in two installments, one due on Jan 31st and one due I believe in June.  The sum of the two installments is the exact same as if I were to pay at once by Jan 31st.

They have also not received any payments (payment was sent on Dec. 1 from Chase). Confirmed the parcel numbers were correct at Chase and the City. 

I call Chase back, essentially useless, get passed around a lot, different responses but essentially saying that was my bill. They opened up a case to look into it more, but basically couldn't do much besides say they were paying the bill that they were sent. I tried the City one more time, nothing really changed, no bills have been sent out.

My escrow account is about 11k in the hole and this payment went out. I'm going to give Chase some time to sort things out.

Is this something I should really be worried about? Sounds like it might just be a bit of paperwork to get a refund back from city. 

Interested to see if any one else has had issues with mortgage escrow payment issues like this.

Need Advice on Taking on Potentially 480K in Loans for Dental School,"I was recently accepted to dental school (yay!) BUT, the school I was accepted to costs an estimated $120,000 a year including estimated cost of living.

Realistically, how feasible is it for me to pay this off? I'm young and need some perspective.

Working in underserved areas is a priority for me, so I will likely move to an underserved area post graduation if I don't get the scholarship.

I know there are payment options like IBR, but I would like to avoid that if possible. I don't think I would want to specialize.

"26 years old, self-employed, no debt, high-income, little behind the eight-ball","Hi all,

I've been lurking PF for quite sometime and referencing the sub-reddit for various questions but after reading many great posts, decided to see what ya'll think.

I'm 26 and run my own business (I do recruiting for high level technical roles for companies in Silicon Valley, Seattle, and SoCal). I've been doing this for about 5 years and have grown quite a bit in income potential.

- Starting off around $35k in my first job
- Quit that job to do 1099 consulting, I did that for 2 years and made around $140k each year
- I took a job at a company, where I made around $125k with great benefits
- I quit 6 months ago to start out on my own and I've made $200k since then

I have zero debt - I didn't attend college and didn't screw around with credit cards that much. That being said, I blew tons of money on dumb things - partying, expensive electronics, pricey apartment rentals, vacations, etc, etc. I essentially didn't look at my checking account during these years and just spent from it. I had no budget. It wasn't unusual to spend $200 a week on going out or taxis. I ordered food like a mad man - $300-400/month. I didn't participate in any 401ks or anything like that either. But I'm ready to get serious about my future and excited to have a really structured plan for 2017. I understand I could've been in a much better place if I started back then but it is what it is.

I've settled down quite a bit in the past year as I've gotten serious with a girl I'll probably be with for a very long time :) so my expenses are somewhat minimal except for the high rent cost of where I live ($1800/month).

I plan on making around $300k in 2017 which is possible with what I've made so far given only 6 month. In January I'll start maxing out a solo 401k and HSA. I also have 6 months of living expenses sitting in a Ally 1% savings account. From there, I was thinking of dumping a few thousand a month into conservative mutual funds via Vanguard. I probably spend 8% of my monthly income on rent, food, expenses, and everything else.

I know this strategy isn't complex or novel but I'd appreciate any tips/advice ya'll have!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5hyol7/26_years_old_selfemployed_no_debt_highincome/,1481571348

Screwed up and missed low interest rates :( (refinancing mortgage from ARM to fixed rate),"Hi, 

If I had been a better husband I would have switched our ARM to a fixed rate two months ago... but I didn't, and I'm not. Now interest rates are up and we've got a hard decision to make.

Some background:

3 years into a seven year ARM on a 600k loan at 3.25%

Wife and I each make enough to cover the mortgage alone, but would be hard, and I'm thinking of quitting/making much less money soon

Some options for us given by lender were - pay another 150k, have low rate and lower principal and lower monthly payments - switch to the new higher rate and have a higher monthly payment - keep with the ARM and refinance in four years.

We have the cash/stocks to do this, but we would then have over half of our wealth in our home. Also I want to make a big life change soon, kid + moving abroad for a couple years + having less high paying jobs.

Feeling a little lost, are there some guiding principals anyone can offer?

Just moved to the US from Canada and looking for advice on US tax free/deferred accounts,"Hi PF!

Here is the situation:

My wife an I just moved to the US from Canada. I am on a TN and she is with me on TD status (so not working). I make $89500. We both had good jobs in Canada and have a decent amount of savings, pension, RRSP (like an IRA) and TFSA (like a Roth). I am currently on a 3 year contract with the possibility of an extension after then. Lets assume my wife doesn’t work for the whole time. I’ll give you the details first:

Me :  33

Savings : $3600 (2 700 usd)

RRSP : $36 500 (27 375 usd)

TFSA : $15 000 (11 250 usd)

Pension : ~$200 000 (150 000 usd)


Wife : 32

RRSP : $8 100 (6 075 usd)

TFSA : $46 000 (34 500 usd)

Savings : $20 000 (15 000 usd)

Bank Stock : $55 000 (41 250 usd)

USD Account : $130 000 (usd)

We are also selling our house, as it wasn’t cost effective to keep it and rent it out. Our worst case scenario on that is another $115 000 (~86 000 usd). 


We will both keep our RRSPs for the time being as they are covered by the US/Canada tax treaty. I am currently on a leave without pay from my old job and will transfer my pension once I confirm i am not returning. About $105 000 will have to be put in a Locked in Retirement account and the other $95000 will be taxed and then invested. 


As I am not well versed at all in the Tax deferred/tax free accounts in the US, my questions are as follows:


1) Should I max out my 401 (k), 457, IRA and Roth with our savings? I was planning on doing that but I am not totally clear on how they work or the rules around them. Currently reading up. 

2) Can i contribute into any tax deferred/tax free accounts for my wife?

3) Any advice on allocation for the greatest tax benefits?

I’ll edit if I think of any more.

How do I evaluate the relative benefits of liquidity vs tax efficiency?,"I'll likely try but fail to make this short while still providing the necessary details.  I'm married, don't have kids, and in my late thirties.  Both my wife and I make good salaries and have good benefits at large companies.  Our salaries have grown a lot in the past five years so the situation is new.  We've paid off tens of thousands of debt and are trying hard to make up for a lack of retirement savings.   We have our six month emergency fund, no high interest debt, and are maxing out our respective 401k's (very low fee target date funds).  We're in a very fortunate position where we are trying to figure out how we can save/invest above and beyond our 401k's.  My company plan allows for post-tax contributions (my wife's doesn't).  From the reading I've done, which has been days and days worth on here, it seems I can make use of the post-tax contributions, then roll them into a Roth IRA when I leave the company or retire.  Alternatively, I could put money in a regular non-tax advantaged account and have access to it whenever I need it and not have to leave my company.  My question isn't which should I do, but how should I evaluate the situation and my choices?  I'm looking for a thought process more than an answer.  I've started by listing goals but honestly, after financial security and retirement, I'm not sure what my other goals are since we don't have kids and already have a house with a low mortgage rate that doesn't really cause me much concern.  As an unrelated aside, we know we're fortunate and giving back through charitable giving is a big part of the plan as well.

Possible Promotion into Supply Chain Management that will put personal goals on hold. Please help PF.,"So nothing is set in stone yet, but I really would like advise before hand just to be prepared. 

My company is currently in the bidding process for a contract (they're on the last round of the selection process) for a Warehousing/supply chain management service for a major corporation that manufactures large commercial transportation equipment (vagueness for anonymity). In the event that they do win this contract, I have been selected to be the Interim Project Leader. 

This ""promotion"" so to speak would require me to live in a hotel for 6-8 months 5 days a week and I would have the option of keeping this roll if I decide I want it sometime during the initial 6-8 months, thus permanently relocating. 

This new position, if obtained, would displace me from friends and family. Additionally, I have not completed my bachelors degree. I am 26 and was planning on returning to school in the spring (I have been readmitted and all set to go). 

My company has already stated they would fit the bill of the hotel room and driving expenses to relocate me 5 days a week. My question for PF is what other compensations should I be looking for? How much increase in pay should I ask for (currently paid 16.50/hr) for a supply chain management position? I was planning on asking for 30/hr or around 60,000/salary? Is this too high? My number is based on increase in responsibility, approximate earning of SC managers, and the fact that I will be giving a lot of my life for nearly a year (if not longer) to my company. This would mean I may not be able to return to university, etc. 

I've never been in a situation like this before and have no idea what to expect. Any help or other suggestions will be GREATLY appreciated. If there is anyone out there currently in SCM, any recommendations on pay would be greatly appreciated.

Is it a bad idea to have your 401K and IRA in the same place?,"So, I paid off my student loans at the beginning of the year and with the amount I am now able to save I am trying to get more serious about managing my money, instead of just letting it sit in a low interest savings account. One of the things that I would like to do before the tax year ends is to open a Roth IRA and max my contribution.

After doing some research, it seems like for a person in my position (aka. a total beginner at investing) the Vanguard target funds are the most frequently recommended option. However, the 401K for my company, which I have been contributing 8% (employer matched) for the last two and a half years is already with Vanguard in the Target Retirement 2055 fund.

So my question is:

Is it a bad idea for me to have both my 401K and my Roth IRA in the same fund? How about having both with Vanguard but in different funds? I see the three fund portfolio referenced often on this subreddit, but as far as I can tell that basically has the same makeup as the target funds, just with more control over the allocations.

She had some individual stocks in the years before 2008 and ended up selling everything at the bottom of the dip. Ever since she has been very dismissive of investing and risk etc. I am going to try and explain that this time around she will be doing ETFs that will disperse risk and that not investing will cause her to lose money due to inflation.

Traditional IRA deduction limits question,"Hi,

My original plan was to further reduce my AGI by maxing out a traditional IRA. But, according to this link I may not be able to this - https://www.fidelity.com/retirement-ira/contribution-limits-deadlines

It says the max to take a deduction from a traditional IRA is 71k AGI. I'm barely above this limit. My question is - does this mean I can't deduct $5,500 from my AGI through the use of an IRA since I'm over the limit? If this is the case, is there another way I can lower my AGI so I qualify for the deduction?

"What to do next? 49, married, wife is 45 and we are both employed, our only real debt is our home.","I just turned 49 in early December.

Long story short, I was a small business owner for almost 25 years. I sold the company to a larger ""competitor"" company, on the condition of having a full time job with benefits, doing pretty much what I was doing at my old business. No windfall buyout, just enough to clear the books, pay the debts and end up with what I called ""used car"" money in my pocket afterwards.

It was a stress related decision to sell the company.

The wife and I both work full time. We gross about $110K per year combined. We have about $60K in ""emergency"" savings, and about $5K in other ""whatever"" savings accounts.

We have no children, nor plans to have any.

We are 8 years into a 30 year mortgage at 4.625%. The balance owed on our $550K home is just under $300K. We also pay an extra $250 a month (approximately, I just rounded out the monthly payment amount) into the principal balance which according to my calculations should cut about 6 years off the term of the loan.

We carry no debt other than the home. (Oh and I think we still owe about $1500 on a Tempur Pedic bed that was 0% interest for 5 years.) We use a joint Citi Double rewards card for everything that we can, and it is completely paid off weekly.

I have a small (1 year old) 401K through my employer, and they do a 4% match to my 5% contribution. There is probably about $5K in there right now. The wife's employer only offers a 403B and we just started that as a 5% contribution a few months ago.

We are completely ""middle class"" and do not live exorbitant lifestyles. We cook at home 4-5 nights a week and go camping as our vacation choice. We pack lunches and fight over the leftovers to take to work. 

We are both ""staycation"" people, but are planning a nice vacation soon. That's what the ""whatever"" savings account is mostly for. We would like to go to Ireland in the near future. We are both comfortable in our lifestyle. We only ""upgrade"" when necessary, and rarely spend money just for the sake of spending money. I buy products we need in bulk for the savings, and the wife is a coupon hound.

At the end of every month, (barring unforeseen expenses, like failing appliances) we are left with about $1000 - $1500 extra that right now I just add to our savings. Typical average is around $1200. I usually put $1000 into the primary savings, and $100 into each of our ""whatever"" accounts. If there is more, great, if not, the ""whatever"" accounts get shorted that month.

At this age, I feel like I should be doing something more than shoveling any extra money into a savings account. I would like to start an IRA (or two for that matter, one for each of us) for the tax benefits. I don't know what the best kind of IRA would be for us though. It's time to make some investments.

My dad was horrified when he realized how much interest was compounding on them (they're ""only"" at 9% interest, but refinancing didn't work because my husband and I have no significant assets to speak of.) The loans are also cosigned by my parents, so they would rather not have 36k in loans on their credit report anymore.

In total, this is going to save us over $20,000 in interest payments over the life of the loans. 

We are going to repay my parents monthly - basically, instead of paying ~$400 a month in payments, we'll be giving my parents a check instead - so as far as my budget goes, this will not impact us in any way and will save me a few years' payments in the future.

How else could this impact us? Credit score, taxes? What's the best way for my parents to do this so we don't get penalized? They wrote us a ""novelty"" check, but the money is very real and will be sitting in their checking account, waiting, very soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kstvn/my_incredibly_generous_parents_are_lump_sum/,1482961399
How much of my paycheck percentage to put into my savings?,"I want to do a vacation trip and am wondering how much of my paycheck to put in my savings account ?

Everything else is taken care by my parents as I am a freshman in college. How much percentage of my paycheck should I put on the direct deposit to go to my savings account so that I can go on a trip by July 29th?

Aftermath after a balance transfer,"Hi all,

I've successfully moved all of my debt to a 0% balance transfer card with a budget to pay it off in the next 15 months (18 month intro period).

My question is what should I do with the credit cards that previously had with balances and were rolled into the new account? I presume I need to keep them open, active, and paid in full each month (not a problem, I'll just route a monthly bill through each) in order to not jeopardize my balance/available balance ratio.

Is that right? Any other things I should watch out for?

It's also worth noting that I'll be leaving my degree aged 27, I'm with my GF(21) currently and it is in my mind that I'd love to propose to her towards the end of the degree/after the degree.. And obviously money is required for this, and as such this is one of the main motivators for me to try and get some for of income!

"2012 Maryland tax lien, but was living in DC","​I have an unusual tax situation and would **REALLY** appreciate any thoughts, input, or guidance you may have. I am very much in over my depth.

I just found out that the state of Maryland has an exorbitant tax lien against me for unpaid taxes in 2012 (they had an extremely out of date address, which is suppose why they didn't contact me any sooner).

**Background**

In 2012 I moved multiple times between Maryland and Washington DC. I worked in Washington DC as a waitress. Because I didn't know any better, I paid my federal tax and filed DC taxes. For my DC taxes I paid ~$273 on top of the ~$1.2k they took out of my paychecks. I did not file Maryland taxes.

**My conflicting addresses at the time**

Maryland

* Address A was on my driver's license and Dept of Education paperwork. This is the address that the state of MD was assuming I lived at when they put the lien on me.

* Address B was on my 2012 federal and DC tax return because I had just moved in

* Address C was on my DC &amp; federal tax returns because I had just moved in when I filed

DC

* Address C was on my W2 for that year and for the previous two years

* Address D was on my tax paperwork from my university


​​**Today**

I called MD to ask about the tax lien because I had no idea what it was about. They told me that I need to send them a 2012 return at which point they will take 4-6 weeks to decide how much I owe them. Because this is such a convoluted mess, I would really love it if anyone could share some wisdom about navigating this situation.


**My questions**

* Should I create a 2012 MD tax return and send it along with my 2012 DC return? Would sending my DC return prevent me from getting double taxed?

* If I get double taxed, is there any way to get my DC money back?

* Because the lien is about 3x more than what I probably would have owed (guessing maybe $1.2k?), could I negotiate with the state to pay less? I could pay $1.2k out of pocket if I really needed, but if I have to pay the entire lien as is ($3k+) it will take me a long time.

* Is it worth trying to prove that I actually lived in DC and thus would not owe MD taxes? I could use my W2 and school paperwork to prove the point and I would just say that MD was my mailing address (which was mostly true because my dad lived there).",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ienub/2012_maryland_tax_lien_but_was_living_in_dc/,1481765476
"25, no debt, 52k a year job, girlfriend who can't work, and have Crohns disease","Hey guys,

So like the title says, I'm 25 and just started a job 3 months ago making around 52k a year. I'm debt free (yay lottery scholarships!), and I'm currently living with my girlfriend who I met while teaching overseas. Because she is an immigrant and currently in the US on a tourist visa she can't work, so I'm financially supporting us both. I also have Crohns disease,which I will bring up later.

Rundown of what I'm doing now:
-Living in a cheap apartment (cheaper than necessary). Around ~800 a month with utilities and internet factored in.
-Have a dependable car that is paid off
-Contributing the max percent that my company will match to my 401k
-Buying as much stock in the company as they will match (something around 2k a year)
-Currently on my parent's health insurance (until May 2017)
-Doing my best to save as much as possible, but not always doing as well as I could (I'm supporting 2 people, and its my first time having an income about 12k a year....)

Here's what I need advice on:

-I'm concerned about not investing enough, but I'm also worried about having enough savings if something were to go wrong with me medically. I'm fortunate to not have to pay for insurance right now, because I have to see my doctor nearly every month or two, and am on 2 expensive prescriptions (although the company's plans help lower the costs). However the nature of my illness is unpredictability, and I've heard a lot of stories about extended hospital stays due to it. So I'm worried about something like this happening once I pay for my own insurance. I really want to invest and grow my portfolio and whatnot, but I also don't want to screw myself over were my health to worsen. What sort of balance would you suggest, savings vs. investing? 

-Also as far as investments go, for a younger guy like me without tons to spread around, should I lean towards something like a Roth IRA, or stocks/mutual funds? 

Thanks for the help!

"Willingly took a pay cut to help employer, and employer is now taking advantage.","I work in the offshore, deep water, oil and gas exploration industry.  I have a degree specializing in rocks and math, and my job is decent enough.  Recently my employer asked me to work a job in the backwoods of Louisiana.  They told me beforehand that I would have to take lesser compensation because the work was easier and my employer got significantly less money for my time than they would if I were at my normal spot offshore.  Wanting to be a team player in difficult times, I agreed to take the cut with the understanding that it was only for the time spent on that particular job.  Of course the next time I returned to my regular job in the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico, my pay rate did not return to my normal rate.  

Do I have any recourse?  If they had just reduced my pay rate, I think that would have been a violation of labor laws, but because I agreed to a short term decrease, I am not sure where I stand.

I'm unsure of my future after the summer since I'll be flying across the country for an internship then moving out and finishing my last year of school when I get back. I'm looking for any help to explain how to balance this all out, since this wasn't covered in my personal finance class.

I have a Wells Fargo checking and savings account, and I have a checking and savings account with a credit union (CU). I keep most of my money in WF since my credit union didn't provide secured credit cards (I got one through WF a couple years ago), chip-based cards (they now do), and the web interface was atrocious (has since improved). I also have a Roth IRA through Fidelity, after switching from State Farm, which I put $100 in to every month.

My money is distributed as such:

- $3,800 in Roth IRA, invested in FCNTX
- $250 in CU savings
- $500 in CU checking
- $8,000 in WF checking
- $500 in WF savings

Should I have more in checking or savings? I just keep enough in the savings accounts to meet minimum balance requirements. 

Should I be using WF over the CU? I've read that credit unions can have better interest rates.

Would short-term CD's be a good option? I don't see myself needing a decent portion of that money for the next 6 months at least.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5julup/how_do_i_balance_money_between_multiple_banks_as/,1482459261
My son may have two SSNs. Need advice.,"My apologies if this is the wrong subreddit, but I figured I'd start here. Long story very short. 

My ex-wife and I divorced many years ago, and have a son together. His legal name, as it appears on his birth certificate, is a hyphenated combination of her last name and mine. However, his name, as it appears on his Social Security card, the one he's been using as an adult, the only number he's ever known or used, simply has my last name on it.

I came to discover yesterday my ex-wife apparently got a second SS card for our son sometime in the distant past; I can only assume because she wanted him to have both names on his SS card, because she's an unstable narcissist, among other things.

I asked my son about it today and said he wasn't sure, but ""thinks he might"" have a second one. I asked him to ask his mother (she and I don't talk) if she got him a second one at some point, and his reply was ""she said she'll check it out today,"" which raises another red flag for me. Either she knows she did or didn't - I'm not sure what there is to ""check out.""

I've asked him to ask her for that second number, if it does in fact exist. I have no idea or evidence she used it for an unlawful purpose, but considering where she was in her life at the time she would have applied for it, and her obsession with wealth and money, I wouldn't exactly be surprised either.

My questions:

How can I go about finding out whether or not my son has another SSN, especially if I don't have the number or access to it? I went to the SSA website today but this isn't a topic I was able to find any information on beyond the usual identity theft links and info.

If I do get the number, my son and I pull his credit history, and there is activity on this number, what are my options? Does the statute of limitations start at the time of the crime or the time of discovery?

If he does have two SSNs after all, can he get one of them cancelled?

Again I apologize in advance if this is the wrong place for this, but I figured it would be a good place to start. I'll try to provide more information to anyone who asks while protecting the identities of all concerned.

Thanks.

*edit - another question came to mind.

I am receiving an inheritance ($~24k) from sale of a family property. I am currently unemployed and receiving SSI. Seeking some advice on what to do.,"Hello,

Within the next 2-3 months, I will be receiving payment from the sale of a family property. The payment will be for ~$24k.   

I am 26 years old. I am currently receiving SSI for PTSD, social anxiety and Borderline Personality Disorder (~$490 per month). Right now, SSI is my sole means of income. Once I receive the money from the sale of the property, I will no longer receive SSI payments, and will be living off of the inheritance.

I have never been financially independent - I have not been able to retain gainful employment because of my disabilities. I am making progress in therapy, and am hopeful that, if I continue therapy, I will be capable of finding employment in the near future.

I currently live with my family, and do not pay rent. I do help out with household expenses, and do have a few necessary monthly expenses of my own that add up to around $150-$200 per month.

I don't know how to say this without sounding self-pitying, or like I'm trying to throw excuses out, so I apologize in advance if it comes across that way - I am still learning to be an adult. Most of growing up for me was kind of just surviving, so I'm only recently learning the skills I need to function as an adult. I am hopeful that this money and the progress I am making with my therapy could give me a bit of a boost to be able to start living more independently, and maybe get started in the right direction to make a life for myself.

What would be the best course of action to take once I receive the payment from the sale of my family's property? I have no/very little knowledge about finances, and would really appreciate any advice you could give me.

**TL;DR:** Unemployed, receiving ~$24k inheritance, sort of completely clueless about finances, and seeking any helpful advice you have to give.

Thanks so much for taking the time to read, and thank you for any advice you're able to offer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5i0isq/i_am_receiving_an_inheritance_24k_from_sale_of_a/,1481590233

I am 30 and have been living with my girlfriend for 7 years, we broke up yesterday and I moved out quickly, I had been saving for a house for the past 3 years and I have 200k liquid at the moment earning 1% and another 20k in what i called the furniture fund, I currently don't anticipate buying a house on my own but maybe I should? I own my car outright and it's still relatively new (2009) 90k Miles. No student loans and no CC debt

My main question is should i continue with my plans of when i was with her and buy a house or wait? My income fluctuates quite a bit but the last few years i've been averaging right around 200-250k but in a bad year 150k would probably be on the low end. Houses here average ~ 750k for a single family and 500k for a condo. I was planning on doing a Single family house to start outright but at this point i don't know... or should i just keep saving and wait for the next relationship before i do anything firm?

Current situation:  
Income 150k-250k  
200k Liquid Cash Savings  
80k SEP IRA  
20k Investment Account

I was turned down yesterday via immediate automated response for the Discover it for Students card due to a collection account. How long do I have to call and try to reverse this decision with a real person?,"I was turned down yesterday via automatic response with the online application. I have an old medical bill in collections that I need to arrange a payment plan for (~$3000, still in school so I can't afford much for monthly payments) and a small $122 bill in collections from around the same time (planning on attempting a pay-for-delete arrangement). 

I'm 25 and my FICO score is 649. I currently only have a Capital One card that is due for an automatic limit increase to $500 from $300 at the beginning of February. As you might notice, I'm in the process of fixing and rebuilding my credit, and I have this subreddit to thank. 

Anyway, I'd like to call Discover and attempt to renegotiate the decision with a real person, but I'm wondering how long after this recent denial I have to renegotiate the decision.

Take the refund or leave it as it is?,"In doing my nightly checking of the accounts, I noticed in my online savings account that I had a few $25 returned check/overdraft fees, all from the company that withdraws my car payment.  (I specifically keep that account stocked with the payment amount for the year and was confused when it ran short).  Did online chat with the bank, the said they could see the car payment company tried to withdraw funds twice.  Logged on to car payment account, last payment was listed at DOUBLE the normal payment, next payment isn't due till March 2017.  

Apparently we set up 2 different auto pays, one through western union and one through GM financial, so we have been double paying our car payment for 3 months now.

The online bank has authorized the fees to be reversed, so that's $100 back in our pocket, and GM has offered us a refund on the payments ($1,788) or we can leave it as it is. 

The money we use to pay for the car comes from an inheritance account that we have to withdraw a certain amount from every year, so starting January 1 there will be a full year's worth of car payments in the online bank account waiting for us.

Stock trading questions on course of sales,"I'm relatively new to stock trading and I'm wondering if someone could help me to understand what I'm witnessing in course of sales each day. 

So I'm currently playing in the speculative $0.50 space and I'm noticing every day with most stocks on my watch list that the course of sales has a lot of these purchases happening (as an example).

50 shares @ $0.550c 12.38pm
21 shares @ $0.550c 12.41pm
16 shares @ $0.552c 12.53pm
312 shares @ $0.553c 12.56pm

... the list is quite extensive at times. 

My questions are why is this happening and who would do it? Take the purchase values of the above trades and it's $27.50, $11.55, $8.83, and $172.53 respectively. Take away buy and sell broker fees (at the cheapest rate possible of $19.95), and the value of each transaction becomes -$12.40, -28.35, -$31.07, $132.63. 

This just isn't profitable practice. Take into account that the peak trading price is no higher than $0.60c and doing this is blatant loss. To make any money at all, even day trading, one would have to be trading in quantities of maybe 30,000 shares per trade, not 50 or 21 or 16. 

So I'm thinking it's manipulation to raise or drop the share the price? Is this why these small packets get traded? 

If it's not manipulation, what is it? And if it is, it must be the very wealthy so how is it legal?

1. The large number of emails I immediately received for such a low-quality car

Backdated pay and bonus questions,"Looking to PF for some opinions on backdated pay and bonuses. I had my review in August and one of the partners basically asked me to accept holding off on increased compensation until Jan 1 of this year. Given I have a degree of respect for her and her partner and did not necessarily need the increased pay at that point in time I accepted with the understanding that the increase would be backdated to my review. 

In thinking about it more I realized I was basically losing out on bonus possibilities during that time as well. I made between 3-4k/quarterly in bonus and 4-5k in annual. Effectively by asking me to backdate but neglecting the bonus aspect I would be leaving up to 10k on the table in bonuses that were not agreed upon prior. 

I am completely within my right to bring this up, correct? Obviously, they have no obligation to actually pay me part of these but I figure it is worth doing so and am looking for general opinions on the matter. 

It is worth mentioning I have no debt or obligation preventing me from walking away completely if they do not agree.

Is Morgan Stanley Reserved worth it?,"A family member has over 1MM in assets at Morgan Stanley and invited me to join in to take advantage of ""reserved"" status for as little as 10k initial investment. I'd probably ramp this up to ~100k within the next few years.

I want to make 2017 my year of rebuilding my finances...how do I get started?,"25/f just graduated with my Masters in Teaching and have started working as a science teacher in a Jr. High in Phoenix. I have been offered a contract for the rest of the year at 22,485 for the remaining 108 days in the school year. I am hoping to kick ass to get re-signed for next year where I will be making ~45k. As a teacher, our retirement is put into a 403(b) plan. My health insurance will be $36/mo., dental and vision are covered by the district. However, I majorly screwed up my finances in my early 20s due to poor planning and general irresponsibility on my part. Here is what I have to work with:

1. Rent: $300/mo.
2. Electric (all other utilities are covered by my landlord): ~40-90 depending on the time of year.
3. Student loan: Will be out of deferrment July, with a payment of $228/mo.
4. Gym: $30
5. Food: ~$120/mo (eat out less than once a month)
6. Entertainment (nights out or drinking wine at home): $50.00 max.
7. Insurance: No car payment, as I paid for my shitwagon in cash. Insurance is going to go up to 100/mo. now that I am in Phoenix.
8. Gas: ~50/mo. I live 10 min. from my new job, but far from grocery stores.

Where I really screwed up was a whole series of irresponsibility on my part in my late teens and early 20s. Looking back, I probably should not have chose to go out of state for school, but I had scholarships for both undergrad and grad school, and as a 16 year old with drug addict parents, I thought it was my only way to escape at the time. I do regret taking out loans, but I can't change it now. I leased a car when I had a decent job at the time, but I voluntarily had it repossessed when I was fired for going to grad school. The balance on that is ~3k. I have been making 20 dollar payments on it since September. I have 500 dollars from an medical procedure that was not covered by insurance, 187 on a JC Penney Credit Card, and a 600 dollar ticket for an expired registration which could not be resolved as my car was repo'ed 2 weeks after the ticket. I realize I was horribly irresponsible, but I would like to change that this year and start to live my life. My ultimate goal in life is to travel. I do not ever want to own a house, get married, or have children. I am getting a Capital One card with a $300 limit in hopes of rebuilding my credit, which will be used strictly to pay for gas.

How do I convince my significant other to invest money (401k/IRA/Brokerage) instead of having it sit in a bank account?,"My significant other and I are two mid 20s working and living in the Bay Area, California. I am currently living at home, while my significant other is renting an apartment in San Francisco. My significant other pays ~$1,500/month for the apartment, including all utilities, not including food, going out, etc. 

I currently max out my traditional 401k with my employer ($18,000/year), contribute the max $5,500 to my Roth IRA, and invest any leftover funds I have in a S&amp;P 500 Index Fund in a brokerage account. I plan to retire as early as possible.

My significant other currently earns ~$65,000/year and contributes 15% (~$9,750/year) of their paycheck into a traditional 401k. Their company unfortunately does not offer any matching at this time. I'm not concerned about the 15% they contribute because that seems to be the sweet spot number recommended here, but rather concerned about the relatively large pool of money they have sitting in their bank account.

My significant other has around $30,000 sitting in their bank account, collecting basically no interest, and I'd love for them to at least contribute to a Roth IRA, and ideally also put more into their traditional 401k to get closer to that $18,000 max. The problem is, every time I try to bring up the topic of budgeting, retirement, investing, etc., they always try to avoid the subject because they're afraid of the volatility of the market, losing money, and would rather keep the money in their bank account. 

I understand it's their money and they can do as much or as little with it as they please, but it pains me to see the money just sitting in their bank account doing nothing. I've brought up the topic several times and tried explaining it several different ways to no avail, is there anything else I can do here?

"My mom is close to rock bottom and I think is finally ready for help, but I'm not sure how to help her.","Hi All,

I'm writing this post in hopes to get some suggestions that I can do to help get my mom back on her feet and be able to support herself. She is 50 years old, recently lost her job, and lives with her boyfriend who is also mostly unemployed. She has struggled with different addictions throughout her life. I know of her drinking problem, more than recreational use of pot, and I am fairly confident she has an addiction to prescription drugs. It has always affected her career (or lack there of), but she was always lucky enough to have other people to rely on that could provide for her/us. 


Growing up, were fortunate enough to have caring grandparents and great-grandparents who ensured that we received a good education and never were in need of anything. My mom and dad divorced when I was a baby, but I did have a stepfather from when I was 2 until around 9 (really liked him). I also had basically another stepfather (didn't actually tie the knot), let's call him John, from when I was 14 until I graduated college. I really liked him too. But all of that good fortune seemingly has come to an end. 


My great-grandparents passed when I was younger, leaving all of their money to my grandmother. She was not good with managing money. She spent most of it and retired to Mexico in an ex-pat community (not a lavish one) because she couldn't afford to live in the US. The men are gone, presumably all caused from the substance/alcohol abuse. She really doesn't have anyone left to support her financially. 


When I was younger, I remember her being a hard worker, even with her vice's. She worked at a bank (I think in HR), she worked in a lawyers office, and I most notably remember her helping prepare complicated tax returns for a CPA firm. She was also still a good single mother who tried hard (made it to our events, teacher conferences, took us to church, etc). She is one of the most hard working and caring people I know which is why it's so sad that she has been plagued by this addiction.


That said, she basically stopped working when she met John, as he is a doctor. The her not working part was not his idea, which also influenced his leaving her. During this time she also got multiple DUI's, and possibly other convictions (she was always out late at night and sometimes wouldn't come home for a couple days). She would also periodically come home with random small tattoos on visible parts of her body (our dog's name on her neck, a flower on her finger, etc). When he left her, he paid for her rent for a year and also bought her a car (or made the payments, not sure). This was supposed to be her time to figure her life out and get back on her feet. She didn't. We tried to have an intervention then. She didn't listen.


One year later (about 4 years ago for reference), the rent stopped being paid and she was forced to sell the car for money. She got a job as a bar-tender at a low end, low traffic bar and started dating one of her regulars. She survived like this for the past 4 years until finally, a month ago, she was let go due to the bar closing. 


Now, she has no money other than what her boyfriend is making. He is on and off again with his construction gigs and does not seem reliable. He also does not seem happy with the idea of supporting her, although he was too unemployed for a while, depending on my mom. They have had differences, and, to my knowledge, she wants to leave him, but she can't because she has no money and both of their names are on the lease. I am scared for what is to come. 


When my family gathered for thanksgiving, it seemed like she is finally realizing that she made many poor decisions and is losing both hope in the future and confidence in herself. My grandpa has money (I think, long story) I make a decent living for 4 years out of school, and my sister makes a decent living also. We want to help, but really don't want to give her cash because we don't know where it will go. Ho do we help her long term?


**TLDR - How do I help???**

Mom is...

▪ **50 yrs old, unemployed** - What jobs might she be able to find?

▪ **Stuck in a lease with a boyfriend she doesn't want to be with** - Would it make sense for us to find out and possibly pay the money to break this lease?

▪ **She has a record (multiple DUIs that I know of)** - how can I find out everything on her record so I know what kind of battle we're facing? She is too proud to say. Also assuming this limits job opportunity.

▪ **She has a suspended license and no car**- How do we work on getting her license back?

▪ **She has visible tattoos** - I'm guessing only further prevents her from going back to work in a professional setting.

▪ **She has a great family who is willing to support, but not sure how. No one can afford to actually fully support her financially.**


Any advice is greatly appreciated - I don't want to lose my mom. My sister, grandfather and I are meeting on Sunday to discuss suggestions (part of the reason for this post) and then we are going to talk to her.

Help with a Job decision?,"Hi PF, 20yo college student here, I have been working as a valet at an outdoor shopping district in very large city. The money has been great &gt;$150 in tips per night. + /hr pay from the valet company. The company I work for uses a tip jar system and tips are cut every night before the end of the shift. (the system works and is not corrupt)

Recently my boss let the staff know (about 60 people) that they lost a contract with a restaurant where I work.  This means that about half the people are going to be transferred. At the same time, although we lost a contract, The parent company was able to sign a contract with a new hotel that is opening downtown late December (late). This hotel has 1000+ rooms and 6 restaurants. It is also connected to a very very large convention building.

Originally I was on the list to be transferred, but I was able to convince my boss to let me stay where I am right now, albeit with reduced hours (2-3 shifts per week). The main things I was concerned about are that the 

New Hotel is

15mi away from my house. (+6 mile commute compared to rn) ~30 mile round trip 

I won't be able to start at the hotel until Late December. 

I have no idea what the tips are like and I know the pay will be from $4-$7.25. My main concern is that with 1000 rooms, conventions and 6 restaurants the Company will be forced to hire tons of valet drivers to keep service smooth, and that no matter how much the extra cars offset the extra people, there will be too many people to have good tip cuts. I hope that made sense. 

Anyway, that's what I don't know about the Hotel. What I do know about where I currently work is that I will be making 

9/hr + tips when I'm working as a valet 

11/hr + tips when I'm working as the valet stand Captain ( my boss says he sees initiative in me and thinks I can 
grow, before this mess I was being scheduled for a captain shift once a week) 

Did I make the right choice In asking to stay? Is this one of those situations I should be like "" hey new opportunity"" ? I need your expertise/wisdom PF.

Rental Washer/Dryer Thrown Away by Apartment Leasing Office,"Ok, fair warning this is my first post on Reddit.

I lived in an apartment for 3 months, and I rented a stackable washer/dryer while I was there. I make monthly payments for them. I moved out on September 23rd, but my lease went until November 3 (was originally supposed to be October 10 but you know the whole 60 day notice of moving out). I schedule online with the company that I'm renting from (Appliance Warehouse) to come pick up the washer/dryer on October 16th. On October 18th I get a call from them that the washer/dryer wasn't there. I head over to the leasing office and talk to a representative and she tells me ""they had it moved out"". I question her further and she then says ""it was disposed of, I don't know where."" I ask why, and her reply is they had already moved someone into the apartment. I'm confused because they made me pay rent for an additional month via their 60 day moving notice but then move someone in WELL before that date and trash the only item that I had left in the apartment: the washer/dryer. Now the rental company Appliance Warehouse wants me to pay $900 to replace it, and I was paying only 40$ a month for renting it.

Considering leaving my job for a PhD. How much are my share options worth?,"Some background:

I've been offered a PhD - it looks great. It's just what I'm interested in. However it would come with a standard EPSRC untaxed stipend of ~£14,500 (I appreciate that whether it's taxed or not is almost irrelevant as it isn't much above the untaxed personal allowance any way). For the purposes of this decision I'm assuming I won't be able to work during this PhD, although my partner is happy to support me (£27,000).

I'm working at a science startup as a senior member of the team. I'm earning £34,000 with an unconditional company pension contribution of 7.5%. I also will have share options (once they've been set up), and it's mainly these that I want r/personalfinance's opinion about, as I want to make as informed a decision as possible.

10% of the company value is set aside as employee share options, so I imagine that, as a small company my share option will be worth at most 0.5% of the company value. Is that unrealistically high?

How much can I expect the company to sell for?

Has anyone had experience of being in a science/tech startup company that's made it to being bought out?

The company aims to be ready to buy within a 3-5 years - am I right in thinking it statistically has approximately a 50% chance of succeeding?


These share options are literally a gamble, and I don't even know the odds or the prize. Consequently, I can't make an informed decision. Any help appreciated.


Any broader advice also appreciated, although as this is r/personalfinance I imagine it will be to keep my job!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5g254m/considering_leaving_my_job_for_a_phd_how_much_are/,1480665478

Gift of Equity/Capital Gains,"Hello, 

My wife and I are purchasing a house from my parents for $700k.  They are giving us a gift of equity of $160K and we are adding $60k to make the full 20% down payment. 

My parents purchased the house in 1973 for $110K so their gains are $590K.  They'll use their $250K capital gains exclusion but does that leave them on the hook for capital gains taxes on the $90K or does the gift equity reduce their basis since they're not actually getting $700K; they're getting $480K?

If not, since they're retired and live off of social security, I understand they might not have to pay any capital gains at all but I also understand that they might get taxed on their social security income?  If true, any idea where I can find out at what rate that would be taxed?

Action to take on open credit cards to minimize credit score decreasing,"Some background: I am a 24 year old graduate student, and I currently have 9 credit cards. My credit limit is $82,100, with 1% utilization (I put about $1000 total on my credit cards each month). All of my credit cards are on auto pay and I pay them all in full every month, and I mainly use one credit card for majority of my purchases. I have never had a late payment. My credit score is 759 on Transunion and 762 on Equifax. I am also a graduate student, so I have student loans. I am currently living off of a combo of student loans and money saved from my part time job. 

The reason I got all of these credit cards was for reward points for travel. I started getting the cards in March, so around that time, the cards will be charging me the annual fee (I only signed up for cards where the fee was waived the first year). My question is, should I cancel these cards, or should I drop them down to a lower level of card that does not have a fee, but keep the account open? Also, should I refrain from opening and more cards to gain any more rewards? 

I was raised to be afraid of credit cards and to look down on people who have a lot of them, so when I tell my family I have so many cards, they get upset with me and think I am going to ruin my credit score/ go into credit card debt. However, all the research I have done has pointed me towards saying it is good to have credit cards, so I try not to let it bother me. Still, I can't find a definite answer of what I should do in my specific situation so that my credit score does not decrease.

So I'm wondering if this idea applies to any other things too, like personal income (as opposed to business revenue)? That is, most employees make between $0 - 100,000 p.a., but while they may fluctuate within this bracket, most never reach the next level bracket of over $100,000 p.a. Obviously everyone would like to make more money but most people are not able to increase their income that much e.g. I make around $40,000 and nowhere near that amount, even if I could get a few years of lucky promotions and/or salary increases.

Do you think if someone reached ""$100K income p.a."" would it would change their financial perspective (mindset, approach to money etc.), and would it be like as if a psychological barrier had been overcome and then it would snowball from there? Conversely, does being so far from away from $100,000 make someone more likely to never get close e.g. like me, I am just a regular guy making a regular salary of around $40,000. Though I have thought to myself that that would awesome if I could one day, I don't have any plans. I can't even imagine ever making that much money.

Does anyone have any experience either way?

Note: The ""$100K income p.a."" could be any figure and would obviously depend on your industry, location etc. I just used it in reference to myself because it seems so high and so far away from what I've been making for the last few years.

Reddit community seems to have Roth IRA targets funds with expense ratios well below mine with USAA.,"After reading through what seems like hundreds of threads, I have come to the conclusion that my Roth IRA target date retirement fund has an expense ratio (1.35%) that is way too high. Granted, the amount in my Roth is by no means staggering, but the 8k I am actively contributing in there and growing seems at risk solely due to the ability to have it grow in a fund with lower expenses. I've called USAA before to work with someone to switch it to some vanguard funds or other available through USAA, but was talked out of it due to the negligible returns for switching. Can anyone offer advice on if it would be worth it to seek out a Roth IRA vehicle, probably a target retirement fund, that would net a lower expense to keep over time?

"Buying a new house, selling current house. How do I make the judgement call of whether the extra $$ per month on mortgage is worth it?","**Our current scenario:**

We are both working in stable jobs that make decent money. We currently own a house that we bought in 2012 (Nov) for 198k (Interest rate of 3.85% with 3% down). The monthly payments are 1250, and we currently make 1400 in payments every month, the extra going to principal.  We now owe 170k on this house. Due to the improvements that I have made (huge backyard renovation, wiring for data, energy saving things like new insulation under house) and the amazing sellers market in our area we estimate the value of our house to be 325k. Making our equity 155k.


Our house has 3 bedrooms and is in a nice neighborhood. I work from home and need one of the bedrooms for an office. We just had our first baby and hope to have another, which is why we are looking (very lackadaisically) for a 4 Bed house.


We bought a new truck in 2015 and have been making double payments (totally 900$ a month) on it since we bought it. At this rate it will be paid off in June and we will have that 900$ a month back. Even with the 1400 + 900 = 2300$ a month big payments we still have enough income to live comfortably and save for things like retirement and kid's college. 


I kinda like this house and apart from having two kids share a bedroom while growing up, we both believe we could be very comfortable in it for the rest of our lives.


**New house found, offer accepted!**

We found a new house in the neighborhood we take walks through a mile or so away from our house. We take walks through this neighborhood because it's our dream neighborhood. Big trees, amazing, older houses with big lots - beautiful. The house we found has everything we want and is gorgeous. It's listed at 390k, so we made an offer for 390k contingent upon the sale of our house (no earnest money down until we accept an offer on our house) and it was accepted!

**Now.**

After fees and taxes we would have about 125K-130K to put down on the new house. That's roughly 30% down and would bring our monthly payments on the new house to about 1860$ after factoring in property taxes and assuming an interest rate that's hovering at 4%.

*That's 610$ more per month than our current required mortgage.

That's 7,320$ more per year than our current required mortgage.

Nearly 90k$ more per decade than our current required mortgage.*

**
My concern:**

We could swing it, probably pretty comfortably. It leaves us less wiggle room if something were to happen. We do have an emergency fund and a lot of fluid funds but more is always better. We won't be able to do as many ""fun"" things. We won't be able to put away as much money for retirement and kids college. We will be paying less than we have been for the last 2 years or so, what with the double truck payments... But just think about what a grand total of 900$ per month more could do!

"Charge off appeared on my credit, never received a bill","Alright, so the story is that I'm a Peace Corps volunteer serving in Ukraine and before I left the states I had Verizon Wireless as my cell carrier. I call them and cancel the service, they of course levy a contract cancellation fee. I inform them that I'm leaving the country for Peace Corps service. Before I leave for Ukraine, I am checking my account on Verizon to see if a bill would appear so that I could, you know, pay it. One never does, and eventually, I can no longer access my account. As the months pass and my schedule here in country gets busier I forget all about it. Today I check my credit score while having some internet time. I come to find that it has dropped 100 points due to a serious delinquency. And that's the Verizon bill that I never received, all $180 dollars of it.

The question - do I have any recourse? I never received a bill, my account was locked out. The only reason I even discovered that something had been charged was due to me checking my credit score. I contacted a rep from there, and they said that it was standard for them to lock out access to online accounts once someone had cancelled their service. How, if they knew that I would be out of the country, would I be able to receive a bill if not through the account?

Wife and I paid off student loans. Best next step?,"My wife and I are 27/28 years old. I make 64k and she makes 45k. Just paid off student loans this morning. No kids, but starting to try. No retirement savings yet because focus was on student loans (4.5+%) and some HELOC balance from home improvement. Neither of our work really has an IRA match. 

For assets we have home equity and some cash. Bought 3 years ago. Was 4.625% 30-year and refinanced last week to 15-year at 2.875%. Loan is $90,000 and monthly payment about $900. Appraised at $135,000 which I think is safe.

I have $4,000 in my checking, and we have $6,000 in our shared vacation/emergency fund. $10,000 HELOC with no balance for additional emergency fund. Neither of us has credit card or car debt but I would like a truck in the next couple years but not necessity. 

Do you think our savings are adequate, especially when trying to have a kid? Should we just start dumping our money into an IRA (*meant to say 401k) and reassess budget when we have a kid? I'm thinking we'll have about a spare $3,500 per month. Should I put extra on the house payment or not bother with the low-interest rate?

"Is ""the power of compound interest"" just a catchphrase used by scammers?","So, every PF book I read is based on this idea of ""the power of compound interest"". Don't buy coffee, invest that money and by the power of compound interest (which you have always underestimated!) you will be a millionaire by the time you retire. Be more strict with your non-essential spendings, and you may even retire early in 5-10 years!

Every time I read it I get all excited. But this is what a quick calculation with excel tells me: if I add €150 each month to my investment funds (that would be 10% of my wage after taxes) and if I can get a reliable 1% profit each and every month, in 20 years I will have a whopping sum of... less than €150.000. Of course this is still completely unrealistic, because I haven't taken taxes into account in my calculation, and I have no idea where to find an almost-sure investment that gains me a 1%/mo (I've tried to ask friends who work for banks and investment companies and they all told me that anyone offering me something like that is probably a scammer).

Before you tell me that this advice only works if you have a well paying job: even if I put €500/mo in the funds it still doesn't work... 

So, is this just a scam that self-help writers use to sell you on the idea that retiring a millionaire is doable by anyone? Or am I missing something?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jx8fk/is_the_power_of_compound_interest_just_a/,1482501912

Credit collections question - Debts being resold,"This is a bit of a strange scenario... About 4 years ago I had a dispute with Comcast when trying to close my account. They were dealing in some shady business practices to extort more money than what was owed. It went unresolved and I allowed the account to go to collections. FICO score was ~810 before the incident, so I was fine letting it go and attempting a pay for delete at a lower rate later.


Being lazy, I never pursued the pay for delete. Credit score wasn't impacted too severely and is still in great standing.


I monitor my credit very closely. The collection was moved (resold?) to different agencies over the years. About 45 days ago, the collection was removed from all 3 credit bureaus. Today I received a letter from another collector for this account offering a 35% discount on the debt.


My question is... what's going on here? I have no problem paying the debt, but I would like to know my options before hand. Is this a legitimate practice? Does the collections account fall off Credit history in the interim between when the debts get resold? If I don't pay, will it resurface on my credit report as the same debt initiated 4 years ago, with the same date of birth?

Frequently asked (and answered) questions,"Since we get new people coming through all the time, let's  highlight common answers to common questions.  (This is not every common question, just all that I could fit in one post.)  Many  of these are also discussed in the wiki.  

**I have $X000, what do I do with it?  What about $X00,000?**

See [this article](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) for handling modest sums, these for [windfalls](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) / [investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/investing).  If you have no other better options, it’s ok to just put $X000 in savings; that’s relatively small as investment principal.  

**Can I afford this much rent?**   

A reasonable guideline for many people is 30% of your takehome pay.  If you live in a place with high costs, you might have to pay more, but then you need to cut back elsewhere, e.g. no car.  If you have very limited income, consider roommates, or renting a room in a house.  

**Should I get a credit card, and if so, which one?**

If you can pay off the balance every month without fail, then a  [credit card](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/creditcards) is a good way to establish credit for free.   If you don’t think you can / will pay it off, or you think you will spend unnecessarily, don’t get one.   The choice of card doesn’t really matter, they are largely similar.   If you have no credit, you might need to get a secured card as your first card.  

**Which debt should I pay off first?**

Make at least minimum payments on everything (since we assume you have no credit card balance).  To build wealth, make extra payments on the highest interest [debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt).   If you need cash flow or want to see progress, paying the lowest balance is another way to go that will cost you a bit more over time if it's not the highest interest.  

**Should I pay down my loans, or invest (more)?**

Yes.  Paying down loans is certain gain equal to the effective interest rate.  Investing is statistical gain at an assumed rate.   We [recommend](https://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.png) prioritizing repaying loans with more than 4-5% interest given today’s economy.  Investing is historically better than paying extra on 3-4% mortgage/car/student loans in terms of wealth building, but if you just don’t like debt, then you can pay it if you want to. 

**How do I negotiate a starting salary?**

Find out what the position is purportedly worth in your local market on sites like glassdoor and payscale.  Focus discussion on your salary goals, not your current income.  Aim high if you are very well qualified or don’t need the job; don’t price yourself out otherwise.  More offers?  More leverage.     

**How do I negotiate a raise?  My co-worker gets paid more than I do.  What do I do?**

You’re not owed more just because of salary differences.  Look for ways to be more valuable, either to your current employer, or another one.  You might find it easier to get more money from another employer that doesn’t see you as being willing to work for your current salary.

**Is this online job offer / Craigslist transaction a scam?**

If you have to ask…  Any time  some Internet stranger wants you to send someone cash / western union / iTunes cards for some sort of “expenses”, it is a scam, whether or not they send you something that looks like a check, or a paypal transfer.

**How much should I spend on a car?**

You can own reliable basic transportation for less than $10,000.   You can choose to spend more, but it’s not financially the best choice; you’d do it for other reasons.  If you’re paying cash, then you are in a better situation to pay extra than if you have to finance the car.  

**What can I do if I owe more on my car than it is worth?**

You owe the balance on the loan no matter what you do.  You can trade / sell the car in if you can pay the remaining balance owed.  If it’s repossessed, you still owe the difference.  Continuing to make payments might be your best option until you have the cash to pay it off.

**What should I do about this old bill in collections?**

You can’t undo credit impact from [collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections) just by paying now.  (If you can get pay-for-delete, that would help.)   Creditors can garnish your income / levy your bank accounts if it’s worthwhile for them to do so, e.g. $X000+ debts to banks.  Consider negotiating old debt if you can’t wait for the statute of limitations to run out. 

**Should I buy a house?**

Yes.  I mean, no.  Well, maybe.  Do you want to live in the same place for an indefinite period, or might you have lifestyle changes / job opportunities that would change that up?  Do you have the income history / credit / savings to get a [mortgage](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/housing)?   Do you want to be a homeowner?  You don’t buy a house just based on monthly payments; you do so because owning a house makes sense for you. 

**I should buy the house anyway even if I think I’d move, right? I’ll just rent it out.**

That sounds better on paper than in real life.  If you want to be a real estate investor, buy investment real estate.  The house you don’t want  to live in any more is probably not your best real estate investment opportunity.  Being an absentee landlord is not for everybody, and maybe not for you.

**Where should I accumulate my money for a down payment?**

Put it in a savings account or equivalent for less than five years.  That’s too short to count on investment gains when your principal is at risk.  For longer term, use a taxable investment account, or possibly a Roth IRA.  

**How do I pay taxes on self-employment income?**

You owe [self-employment taxes](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/self-employed-individuals-tax-center) of about 15% on your next business income (after deducting costs).  Then you owe income taxes based on all your income and deductions.  30% or even 40% is not unheard of for total tax on self-employment income.  You can / should pay quarterly taxes if you are not having enough taxes withheld in other ways.  

**Should I cash out my retirement account?  I could use the money.**

If you have to ask…  This is probably a bad idea if you would owe penalties on the money, which is typical.  You often lose 30% or more in taxes if you cash out an IRA, and you lose future growth.  This would be a last resort if you have no other source of income.    

**I haven’t filed / paid my taxes in years.  What do I do?**

File your taxes, possibly with help of a tax accountant.  You won’t go to jail; the IRS wants your money, not you.  (If you were knowingly committing fraud, an attorney couldn't hurt, though.)  If you had money withheld, you might even get refunds for the past up to three years.   If you owe money, you would have to figure out how to pay that, perhaps with a payment plan.  

**Do I owe taxes on receipt of a large gift of money or property?  What about an inheritance?**

No.  Even if it’s more than $14,000.  No federal taxes on [gifts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/gifts) / inheritances of money / investments / property.  There are some very limited scenarios where you might owe state taxes, but you almost certainly don’t hit those, either.  Same deal for inheritances, except for inherited IRAs/401ks.

The simplest way to save money,"I want to offer you an interesting method to save money. It works great for my country, so I think it can help people outside it.

The trick is that you plan a period (a month, for example) considering all important income and expenses during this period. As a result of planning you get an average daily expenses (ADE). Then all you need to do is to spend less money than your ADE every day. The difference between your ADE and really spent money can be stored in ""savers"", that will help you to account all saved money.

This method lets you to always know, how much money do you have in your wallets, and to always be sure that money for important expenses are reserved. You also don't have to think, how much money can you spend today. And you can create many different ""savers"" for different purposes.

This method is pretty simple, but it has great efficiency. I've implemented it in an Android app called ""Saver 2.0"", but users from outside my country don't know about it! :(

I really hope that reddit will tell the world about this simplest way of saving money. Have a nice New Year with savers full of money!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5l3cs2/the_simplest_way_to_save_money/,1483103360
"24 y/o in a good position, wondering if down-payment on home is a good idea.","Hello! First time posting in this subreddit.  I've seen people get some great advice / info here and wanted to see if anyone could help me out.  I recently had a work-related influx of cash and I'm wondering if it would be a good idea to pay a down payment on a home vs invest the money.

Some details:

Living in San Francisco, currently paying about 1900 in rent (4 bedroom with 3 roommates)

Generally low expenses (no car / no kids / free food, transportation, perks from work)

No debt

Making ~160k

Can commit to putting down ~300k currently.

I hate paying rent in San Francisco as It feels like throwing money away (and dealing with San Francisco landlords is quite an ordeal), so I was wondering if it would be a good idea to purchase a home.  From my rough calculations it seems like I would be able to afford a 2 bedroom for around 800k to 1.1m on a 30 year fixed mortgage,  though I'm totally new to this so if I'm way off here please let me know. Additionally I would look to rent out the second bedroom to a friend, perhaps a 3 bedroom and rent out 2 rooms, if possible.  I understand that an arrangement like that would only be temporary at best and I should not include possible income from that in the decision.

Basically 2 questions: 

1. Can i afford the type of home I'm thinking of?

2. Is buying a home a good investment given how expensive rent is in San Francisco or would it be better for me to invest the money some other way.

One more thing, my company has a 50% 401k match that I have been contributing the full 18k/year to as well.

I'm very new to this whole process and am doing some research by myself as well as talking to family, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kf0i1/24_yo_in_a_good_position_wondering_if_downpayment/,1482776936
"Is it beneficial or harmful to place fraud alerts on your account if you're *not* a victim of ID theft, just to prevent potential thieves from gaining access to your ID?","I was thinking about something today as I was checking over my Equifax credit report and checking the bottom bit about Identity Theft.

Is it beneficial (or even possible) to place the ""Initial Fraud Alert"" on your account if you've not been a victim of ID theft? Meaning, you'd place the alert on your credit report only to prevent future attempts at people trying to open accounts in your name.

Is this something that people do if they don't anticipate a change in their credit or if they don't anticipate needing anymore credit for a long time? I'm in a financially stable position where I may never need to take out another line of credit for quite a long time. I have three credit cards (work travel that gets paid back monthly with reimbursements in my paycheck, a Auto body shop credit card to grant me discounts on car repairs and an emergency credit card that just sits there that I buy gas on every so often and pay it immediately back to keep the account open), a mortgage only 2 out of 20 years old so I don't see a need for me to take on more debt and I already handle my credit carefully.

Is there an established way to get from $0 to $20k annual passive income?,"This is probably an insane and poorly-worded question but you may know better than I do. Money is overwhelming and intimidating to my stupid brain and history of poverty. 

I want to tell you to assume I have no marketable skills or abilities, but more honestly, it's just that I have social anxiety that makes the idea of running my own business hustle terrifying, and I also have no interest in toiling away 40-80 hours per week of my life to make someone else rich while I barely survive. 

Ideally (and I think this is the goal of Universal Basic Income) is to have my basic food and shelter and survival needs met without me having to worry about them, so that I can focus 100% of my time and energy on things I want to do but don't have time for because of work. Things like writing books and articles, building and maintaining a website or online business, playing music at local shows, doing photography and illustrations, thinking about important philosophical concepts, volunteering, trying out business ideas without my entire livelihood being at stake, things like that. 

I wouldn't be lazy. I would create things that benefit the world. Right now, I don't create much of anything. I really don't accomplish anything in life, and definitely nothing at my shitty normal jobs, besides burning through 1/3 of my life for nothing but basic survival. I'm exhausted and I have nothing to show for it and I still worry about whether I'm going to be able to afford food and shelter. 

This probably sounds like entitlement, if you've even read this far. Maybe it is. I personally think the US is at a place, resources-wise that satisfaction of basic survival needs should be guaranteed for every citizen, no questions asked. If you want more than that, then work your ass off to get it. But food and shelter? Those don't need to be luxuries anymore. 

Not even totally sure why I'm posting something that is almost guaranteed to get hate and downvotes, but I overheard a conversation yesterday between a young financial advisor and a young business owner. The business owner just started his blue collar business after losing a job in the field. He has no employees. He asked if it was possible to be worth $1.5 million in 3 years. The financial advisor said he didn't see why not. 

It made me realize I don't know anything at all about money or even the right questions to ask. So I'm asking you.

Severance vs. Unemployment,"(Repost from /r/Unemployment)

Hey all! Long story short, due to my trying to do the right thing by informing my employer that I am searching for something closer to home (2 hour commute currently, Northeastern U.S. winters making it tough), I've been offered two weeks severance or they ""might have to make a decision"". 

Can I still apply for unemployment if I take it?

Is this a realistic/ feasible goal?,"So the past few months I've been doing a lot of soul searching, and with that a lifestyle change. I'm currently transitioning more into minimalism for the environmental benefits because those are important to me and to not be so ""wants"" obsessed. I'm also currently making my vegan transition and have taken up yoga and meditation which I believe has been extremely beneficial and has helped me define what is actually worth value in my life. This is important because I have realized travel and experiencing different cultures is very important to me over anything materialistic. 

So I would really like to be one of those people who manage to visit almost every country/ a very large part of them. Or at least be financially able to afford everyplace I would like to go which covers about 40ish countries. I have looked up costs, and while nobody can provide an exact breakdown the average is around 100,000 with hotel, transportation, food, attractions and so forth. Now I do understand that number is projected to grow with interest. So I would like to be able to accomplish this and travel around age 30-35 giving me roughly 12-17 years to save. I'm going to put the rest in parts to make it more manageable. 

1. I am willing to nix my spot at my dream college (almost Ivy League and highly competitive) costing about 62k a year to be able to travel. Though I am expecting roughly 20k in aid and my parents will match that so I'm looking at 22k of debt, which I do understand is still a large amount especially for a five year program. But I would be expecting a 40k higher starting salary right out of college and the starting Salary for my current degree choice is around 100k. So would it make sense to go to this school, if the aid checks out, because I would be making more to easily pay off my debt? Or would it be better to go to a cheaper school, take the lower salary and pay off my debts that way. (My dad makes too much to be given any aid for a state school so no I will not be going to college without paying at least 30k for my education). 

2. I do plan on living somewhere where public transportation is the main form of transportation. I do not wish to own a car and would like to be able to bike everywhere or use public transport. Now I do understand that depends on where I get hired, but I do not want to own a car unless absolutely possible. I also plan on living well below my means. I do like the minimalistic lifestyle and if I could possibly like off of 40-50k or at least half of my income a year I would be happy. So with that would I be able to build an emergency fund, invest, create a good retirement fund, and realistically plan to travel in roughly 17 years? 

If anyone has any advice or other opinions they would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5fx3kz/is_this_a_realistic_feasible_goal/,1480605715
International student in US looking to grow internship money,"I went through the sidebar and the rest of the links but they generally seem to have guidance for long term planning.

I'm an International graduate student at a reputed Boston based university. I'm graduating in December 2017 and I plan to go back to my home country after that.

I managed to get an Internship from January 2017 -  August 2017 which will pay me enough to cover my last semester of college (Sept 2017 - Aug 2017). But since, I'm planning to go back to my home country, so a long term plan doesn't seem like a good idea. Is it possible for me to earn something on the salary I'll earn during my internship?

Here is a breakdown of my expected earnings and spendings:

* Expected Monthly Earning: $3800 (After-tax)
* Expected Monthly Expenditure: $1500 (Rent + Utilities + Groceries + Transportation + reserve for unexpected expenditures)
* Savings per month: $3800 - $1500 = $2300
* Duration: 7 months 15 days ( ~ 160 working days)
* Total Savings: Duration * Savings per months = 7.5 * 2300 = $17,250

So, I'll save a total of $17,250 by end of August 2017.

Planned expenditures from savings: 

* Grad School Fees: $13,000 (To be paid on 30th August 2017)
* Anticipated Monthly Living Expenses (Sep - Dec 2017): $4000 - $4250

But since I won't be needing this money before the end of August, so is there someway I can invest it and earn on it for that 8 month duration? Keeping it in my savings account doesn't seem like a good idea because there is hardly any interest given on that in US.

** Anticipated (monthly) living expenses for the duration of my last semester is based on my current expenditure and thus less than the amount I'll spend monthly while working.

TL;DR: Need a way to invest around ($17,000) over a duration of 8 months and to have access to all the money at the end of the 8 months for future expenditure.

Long time debt with a really low credit score. The debt is under 10k. I need a new car and to fix my credit. What can I do?,"Like the title says, I have a low credit score. It's in the lower 400s. I've been pretty terrible throughout my whole life with finances. I'm getting older and I need to grow up and take care of it. My total debt is a little under 10K. Lots of the debt was written off over time. 


I work a decent job for the area that I live in (middle Tennessee) and make about 36K a year. My car is taking a dive and I need a new one.

Retirement investing advice,"Hello PF!

Lurker for some time now. I want to invest in my retirement. I am 34 years old. My emergency fund sitting at around $15k. Only debt is mortgage (380k) and car loan (5k). My old 403b and current employer retirement fund is roughly $110k.

Now that I have some extra money ($2000), I would like to invest it into my retirement. Would it be better to start a Roth IRA or mutual fund with the $2000 or would it be better to start a Roth IRA and mutual fund each with $1000 and put $100-$150 into each every month.

Already own a home/mortgage and looking to sell and move to another.,"Sorry if this is a fairly basic question but I am a home owner that is looking to sell in the next 12 months to move into a newer property.  My goal is to make anywhere from $30 - $50k profit on our current home and use most if not all of that on a downpayment for the next but here is my question...  what is the best strategy on buying/selling at the same time?

The idea of moving into a temporary living situation in order to sell first really stresses me out.  Potentially racking up extra storage costs and moving costs, not to mention the time off work just to get semi-settled into an interim location, seems overwhelming.

Our current mortgage payment is $1,200/mo and it feels like it'd be overall easier to save up a few months of extra payments to potentially buy the next house first and move in before selling ours.  The only thing that terrifies me about this are all of the ""what ifs"" such as not finding a new house quickly enough and being stuck with 2 mortgage payments, or for that matter not having the profit to use as a downpayment on the new one.

I'm mainly wondering how a bank might handle this.  My understanding is we'd want to strive to put 20% down on the next mortgage in order to lock into a traditional one with no PMI.  Is there a way to put less down upfront followed by a larger lump sum payment that would alter the longterm monthly payments?

I guess I'm just wondering what the general recommendation is for somebody who CAN afford 2 mortgages for that extra 3 month period or so.  I should note that our goal would be to aggressively move on a new house the second we got a firm offer on our current one.

In heath insurance limbo... again.,"My first plan just disappeared when the company quit providing health insurance, my second plan was even more expensive (luckily I reapplied for and received the tax credit a few months in) but I forgot to change over billing info when my bank changed credit card carriers... so now I'm back to being uninsured and find myself in a country that may be dismantling the Affordable Care Act anyway. 

I'm a healthy young adult female and was basically breaking even on my insurance because it's just about the cost of my birth control which was covered ($153 without insurance), and I still paid something out of pocket at every single doctors visit, even my annual visit to the OBGYN (which is my only regular medical care, I'm blessed in that I'm rarely sick and even less often injured) cost several hundred dollars

Should I find another plan? 

Will I still be paying penalties on the months my coverage lapsed? 

For me, paying out of pocket for my medical makes more sense financially. And visiting Mexico for medical care or prescriptions isn't out of the question either thanks to my geographic location. Aside from the big chunk being paid all at once for the penalty (which might just be taken out of my return anyway, I usually get several hundred back)... 

I grew up as a military brat so civilian medical care baffles me, I spent over two decades walking in for treatment and out with no bill. Navigating this health care landscape (or wasteland) doesn't come easy to me. I usually went for low premium high deductible plans when I did have coverage, and went from Tricare to my mothers insurance to these two from the Marketplace in the past 5 years

"I owe back taxes, what should I do?","I owe back taxes (~14,000) to the Feds - it's @ 4% interest, and I'm going to owe more for 2016. I'm sitting on ~12k of usable money (aside from bills), I'm curious how I should handle the situation...

The feds allow you to make a payment plan. Currently I'm paying $250/mo (which will basically never pay it off, since the next year will come in and go on top of it). Should I continue to pay that amount ($250/mo) - basically forever, increase the amount so I'm paying it off each year or two, or pay off a big chunk?

Young Professional Looking for a Bank,"I am looking for a good bank suited to a (poor) (soon to be) young professional.

Currently finishing my last year of vet school, and about to go into a low-paying internship. Breaking up with my (no longer) local credit union.

Things I'd like for a bank:
-Minimal fees (small annual/maintenance fees)
-Overdraft protection
-Easy access online
-24/7 support via phone/online- I don't have ""normal"" hours, and don't have a lot of time to go to a brick and mortar place
-Easy management of multiple accounts

Things that aren't important for me (at least for the next few months):
-Investment options
-Credit card options
-Home/auto/business loans

Nice but not essential:
-OK interest on savings
-Compatible with Mint and Digit
-Minimal penalty for inter-account transfers

This is my first bank I'm selecting independent of my parents, so I just want to make sure I'm not walking into traps, and would rather not learn by experience. I don't have a lot of money (student, then intern) so I want to maximize the money I do have, and keep it somewhere smart.

I've researched Simple and Capital One 360- opinions on those and other options would be great. Thanks!

(US) - 38 and starting a new job. I won't be able to contribute to the 401k for a year. What are my options?,"Hi /r/pf.

I'm starting a new job in January, and there is a one year waiting period before I will be able to start contributing to their 401k. I didn't really start saving for retirement until I was nearly 30, so feel far behind where I should be at this age with less than $100k in a mix of Roth and Regular IRAs.

I plan to max out my IRA contributions next year, but was hoping to find a way to put away more than that $5500.

I have a disregarded entity LLC that receives a small amount of income (~$500-600/mo) from an old consulting retainer, and if I'm reading correctly it sounds like I could contribute 100% of that income to an Individual 401k. 

Is this worth setting up for a year, or should I just be saving in a taxable account? Do I have any other options?

I have ~$50k in non-retirement savings ($40k earning 1%, ~$10k in a 65/45 stock bond mix), which is a couple of years of living expenses for me. I'm pretty conservative financially, so having even more of an emergency fund would provide piece of mind but almost having more in cash than retirement seems unbalanced.

Thanks for any insight!

[edit]

Thanks for the advice everyone, even those that called me stupid.

My plan is as follows:

1.) Max out my IRA for 2017 - I had already planned to do this.

2.) Contact Vanguard about an Individual 401k account. If it's not too onerous in terms of fees and time managing it, I will put 100% of my LLC income into this account. Otherwise, I will put what I would have put in this into the account in #3.

3.) I will put the rest of what I would have put into the new company's 401k for 2017 into a more aggressive ETF mix as a taxable ""retirement"" account.

4.) I'm going to considering moving $10-15k of my cash into a conservatively balance ETF mix gradually over the next year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5jjmb3/us_38_and_starting_a_new_job_i_wont_be_able_to/,1482322703

1- Buy a new phone outright (~$800) because I'd really like a new one after 3 years with my current phone.  
2- Put $400 in savings, spend some on things I would like around the house, and take a $30/month payment plan with the phone.  
3- Do not buy the phone at all, save $400, keep the rest for incidentals.

So what do you guys think? She wants to make sure the direct loans still quality for ""Public Service Loan Forgiveness"".   Is utilizing PSLF a viable plan for her loans?  Are there any other healthcare related discounts she should try to utilize?  We know about Federal Quality Health Center (FQHC) loan repayments.  Unfortunately her first job does not quality.

"Skipping the ""starter home""","My wife and I make a combined $160,000 per year.
Location: Halifax (Canada)
We have around $10,000 in debt (car).  Our student loans are paid off. No credit card debt aside from the operating amount we fully pay off each month.

Savings: we saved over $55,000 this year, in a variety of investments and accounts.  Same last year. $45,000 the two years before (daycare). Nothing saved prior to that due to having one income, and that income  was substantially lower than it is now. We did manage to pay off student loans during that earlier time.

We currently rent for $1100 a month and have 2 kids.

We are now in the market to buy a home.  I can put $110,000 down.  

My credit score is in the 740's and we were approved for a 2.5% mortgage with a ridiculous ceiling, over $800,000. I question the sanity of the banks.

What can we really afford, based on our savings profile, income, and other info?  Is $550,000 reasonable based on these stats? We want to get our dream home and then stay put.  My family suggested $250,000 is a safe amount to spend based on our income. There is a large gap between the numbers being advised to us.

Do long term capital gains get taxed at a marginal rate?,"Ordinary income [is taxed at marginal rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/4vodru/i_put_together_this_explanationreview_of_marginal/)
   
Does something like this apply to [long-term capital gain income (LTCG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax_in_the_United_States#Current_.282016.29_law) as well?
   
Let's take a few cases where, to keep it simple, ordinary income is already after all applicable deductions and the applicant is single:
  
1. Your ordinary income is $0. You have no job but you sold $10,000 worth of stock.
You are in the 15% ordinary income tax bracket and 0% LTCG rate. 
You pay $0 in taxes.
  
2. Your ordinary income is $0. You have no job but you sold $50,000 worth of stock.
You are in the 25% ordinary income tax bracket and 15% LTCG rate. 
You pay (50000 * 0.15) = $7,500 in taxes.
  
3. Your ordinary income is $30,000. You sold $8,000 worth of stock.
You are in the 15% ordinary income tax bracket, but 15% LTCG rate. 
You pay (927.50 + (30000 - 9275) * 0.15) = $4036.25 in ordinary income taxes.
You pay (8000 * 0.15) = $1200 in LTCG taxes.

4. Your ordinary income is $30,000. You sold $7,650 worth of stock.
You are in the 15% ordinary income tax bracket, and 0% LTCG rate. 
You pay (927.50 + (30000 - 9275) * 0.15) = $4036.25 in ordinary income taxes.
You pay $0 in LTCG taxes.
   
   
In scenario #3, the capital gain essentially pushed you over into the 25% ordinary income tax rate bracket, which has a 15% long-term-capital gain tax?
**This is a difference of $1,200 of extra tax for a mere $350 difference in long-term capital gain**
   
Am I completely off on how capital gain taxes work?
Or, is there a marginal tax system for capital gains, similar to the ordinary gains? I haven't been able to figure this out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5giasf/do_long_term_capital_gains_get_taxed_at_a/,1480892070

Also I am in a state where medicaid has not been expanded. So my current option is to pay a ridiculous premium per month (250+).

I am newly unemployed, making a whopping monthly income of $0, and unsure when i'll be able to find employment in my field (hopefully soon).

She also has a car loan from said local credit union so I might go there as well. Cap one's auto loan system is extremely easy and convenient but I hope I'm not paying too much for that convenience.


On a side note, I feel that the 11-13k price point will give me a pretty decent, later model car that would be a good investment without being extravagant.

Dealing with a fraudulent debt collection?,"A company called FMR ([Worldwide Processing Group?](http://worldwideprocessinggroup.info/))has been attempting to collect a non-existent debt from my girlfriend for the past 6 months.

Based on what we're seeing on the BBB site, there's a lot of fraudulent activity here - whether it's purely on their part or someone fraudulently trying to collect debt and they buy up the cheap debt, I don't know.

What are our options to make them go away?  I can block their numbers with Google Voice but they seem to have a different number each time.

Value of an internship vs Part time/Temp Job,"Hey there r/personalfinance,

I have roughly 6-7 months before i start university, and intend to use this time to work. Thing is, i'm undecided between getting an intern position or looking for a part time/temp job. I'm under the impression that internships can be more valuable for networking and provide more learning opportunities but how true is that? (never interned before). Are interns really given opportunities or are they in reality made to do mundane tasks? Interns are also generally lowly paid, especially here in Singapore, so i wonder if getting an internship for this half year will be worth the trade off in potential earnings compared to if i were to take up a temp job that could potentially give me twice the amount.

If it helps, i don't have a fixed industry that i have set myself to work in in the future, but if i were to intern it would probably be as a marketing intern? Then again, i wouldn't mind any industry if the experience as an intern is as enriching and rewarding as i imagine it to be.

This will allow me to get invested in the bond fund, and also convert VTSMX into admiral shares. 

Of course, investing $3000 into the fund will throw off my asset allocation, but I intend to re-balance it as time goes on.

A look at their website ([link](http://credencerm.com/)) indicated they're involved in bill collection (""First Party Collections...Third Party Collections""), so I asked if they were a bill collector.  They refused to say but just repeated that they were involved in personal business matters.  I finally gave them my phone number because I had heard of bill collectors causing financial hell for people they had misidentified.  The company then asked if I was a certain person with a completely different name from mine and who I've never heard of before.  I told them to put me on their Do Not Call List and hung up.

Rolling a Traditional IRA over to a Roth if I have never taken a taxable deduction,"Hi guys,

I've been reading PF for about 5 months now, but this is my first time posting. I've had a traditional IRA for about 3 years now that I started with money I received as gifts from high school graduation. I graduated from college in 2016 and started working full-time about 4 months ago. The ira has about $2,500 in it and I recently moved it to Vanguard. 

I believe Roth is currently the better move for me, so I intend to max my Roth in 2017. Wasn't able to contribute in 2016 because I was saving up an emergency fund, which is now at about 7.5k. I also think that leaving this money in my ira will complicate matters if I want to contribute to a Roth IRA via a Backdoor Roth contribution in the future because believe my income will rise significantly.

The question that I'm wondering about is whether I can rollover the $2,500 I have in my Traditional IRA to a Roth without incurring significant taxes. I have never filed taxes before, so i've never claimed my contribution as deduction. The account has seen some appreciation over the years (about $500), so I know I might have to pay taxes on that amount, but I would prefer not have to pay on the full $2,500 amount. Does anyone have any advice on how to pull this off smoothly? As I mentioned, I recently moved the account to vanguard from etrade, so is there any information that I should pull from etrade for tax purposes before it's too late?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5kr3qz/rolling_a_traditional_ira_over_to_a_roth_if_i/,1482943069

Weird Issue RE: Mutual Funds,"PF,

I am estranged from my parents.

At some point during my youth, my father purchased mutual funds and put them in both of our names.  He had me sign paperwork for it which I thought nothing of at the time (I was like 13 and my dad was telling me to sign a form).

Years and years later, he retired and has started to sell these mutual funds.  I have received bills from the IRS stating you know... I owe like 35,000 dollars because of unclaimed revenue, which started me at the time.  The 3rd time it happened came after I got married and scared the shit out of my wife.

The first two times weren't really a problem, but with a lot of legislative aggression against the IRS, it took like 2 hours to resolve because there were no goddamn operators.  Usually I just tell them, ""X claimed it.  That's not really my money.""

I don't want this crap to come around another time, but I also have no contact with my father and prefer it that way.

Do I have any liability on these assets for real?  Like if he didn't claim them would I owe on them?  Seems unlikely given that I signed the paperwork as a child.

If that's the case, CAN he be selling these without my permission?  Could I remove myself from them without consulting him?

Everything is complicated by the fact that I don't really know how much he bought, when he bought them, and what company they're with.

"Received $25,000 gift... we now have about $40,000 in our checking acct. How best to invest about $30,000?","Hello,

My wife and I unexpectedly received about $25,000, and I am looking for the most efficient way (ie, lowest tax burden, highest long-term growth potential) to invest about $30,000. My goal is to have a safety net of $10,000. A little about us - combined income of ~$110k before taxes, married filing separately (student loan issue, so no Traditional or Roth IRA), and early 30's. We both work for organizations with 403(b)s which we are currently putting the minimum in (up to the employer match basically). I am thinking of three options:

1. Keep all the money in the checking account, but increase the amount invested directly into the 403(b)s from our paychecks by about 95% for several months. We would draw down our checking account down to about $10,000 (our safety net), then reduce the amount invested per paycheck to more reasonable levels. **I think this is the best option** - since the money that goes into the 403(b) is before taxes, its like we are getting ""bonus"" money invested. Cons: My 403(b) is pretty crappy (only option is Invesco stable asset fund, which is high expense ratio and very low risk/reward); my wife's is actually pretty good (Fidelity with lots of low expense ratio index funds).

2. Just throw $30,000 in to Vanguard. Advantages - very simple to do this, plus Vanguard has the best investment options overall (compared to our 403(b)s). Disadvantages - no tax advantages here.

3. Actually I can't think of any other options LOL.
