Investing retirement fund vs S&amp;P 500 Index fund?,"I've read a lot about how over a long period of time, the S&amp;P 500 index fund will average about 7-8% increase per year.

Student Loan Repayment,"Hello pf,



I just have a question about my student loan. Long story short, I spent last year at a state school and now have $5,500 in loans to repay. One loan is a subsidized that started with an original amount of $3,500. The second one if an unsubsidized loan with an original amount of $2,000, with both loans fixed at 4.410%.



Since October 9, I've made a total of $168.81 in payments towards loans and interest. I understand that the interest is paid before my principal balance, and currently have a balance of $5,465.46, with most of the payment going towards interest. I know that my loan server has a policy of late fees paid first, then interest, then the principal balance. I am signed up for auto payments on the 9th of every month, and will continue that. 



My background:

-My monthly income fluctuates anywhere from $300 to $800 a month (yay for fast food)

-I have about $600 for an emergency fund



After moving back home, I started CC and my parents pay for mostly everything, and I'm very grateful for them and the situation I'm in. I get payed on the 5th and 20th of every month, and I transfer 25% of each check into a savings account. My monthly expenses include:

-$80 for gas

-$57.85 for auto payment on loan

-$5.29 for Spotify



I subtract the 25% savings all monthly expenses from the first pay check and the rest is spending money if needed. After saving 25% of the second pay check, I divide the remaining amount by 2, and put half towards an extra loan payment and the other half towards my emergency fund. I know this is very complicated, sorry.



I realize this might be a little too much information or not enough, but my question is should I save up for a lump sum every so often, or make extra payments right after my auto payment? I feel like I'm chasing my tail with paying interest. Right now I have a little over $200 extra for a payment, so would it be beneficial to make that payment right after my auto payment or keep saving for a couple months and make a payment of $1000 or so? Making smaller payments towards my principal balance will reduce my interest over time, right? Any help would be greatly appreciated and Merry Christmas!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3y8hqj/student_loan_repayment/,1451091504
"I graduated college 2 years ago and still have $105k in student loans. Feel betrayed by the USA mantra that ""college is necessary"". I am being charged 7% through federal loans. What can I do?","I attended an expensive private college and am left with $105k in student loan debt after two years of paying down.

Here's what infuriates me: I am being charged $7350 this year in INTEREST ONLY because the rate is 7%. For a country that claims to *value* and *invest* in education, this is way too high of a rate. I did attend a expensive private school, but coming from a family of high school graduates, I relied heavily on my high school guidance counselor's advice. He told me that attending a private university for $50k a year would be better for my future than an in-state school for $20k a year because of the school's *reputation*. 

Current financial situation: I luckily earn $60k a year now. After taxes I make $40k. After expenses, I have $15k leftover to put towards the loans. I have perfect credit and have held my job for 1.5 years.

How can I get this rate lowered? I am currently borrowing $25k in my own name as a federal loan, and $80k under my mom's name as a parent plus federal loan. Does anyone have success of refinancing for less? Would you go to a credit union or an established bank? Or is federal as good as it gets and this is just what I am doomed to pay over the next 10 years? I had dreams of building wealth through passive income, but it barely seems like a possibility anymore.

23m - How quickly should I pay off my $20k student loans? $95k/yr income,"Overall financial picture:

Month-to-month:

- Pre-tax pay is $7.9k/mo.
- Contributing 12% to my Roth 401k.
- Take-home pay is $3.9k.
- After expenses ($~2k/mo -- half being rent), I am left with ~$1.5k/mo.

In aggregate:

- $38k in cash (checking account)
- $4k in Roth 401k
- $20k in RSU's

Loans

- $4,500 @ 3.4%
- $2,750 @ 3.86%
- $3,500 @ 4.5%
- $5,500 @ 4.66%
- $  750 @ 5.0%
- $1,007 @ 6.8%
- $1,509 @ 6.8%

I am currently paying back $50/mo on the 5% loan and $500/mo towards the rest. The trade off is putting more money into my 401k (goal is to eventually get to a 20% contribution), or start putting the money in a brokerage account for investing.

Help me convince my girlfriend's family to not buy a house (or should they?),"So my girlfriend's family (siblings' ownership, parents pitch in for the downpayment) is planning to get a house. Location is Manila.

3 siblings, and one parent included in the payments of a house. 

2/3 siblings have recently graduated and haven't started working yet. Reason for buying a house is because everyone will be working in the CBD and they thought buying would be easier with a whole family, rather than individually rent paying ""dead money"".

**House details :**

 * Total Contract Price : Php 2,650,000
 * Downpayment of 30% will be paid by the parents
 * Balance would be Php 1,820,000 payable in 15 years at 20,686 per month 

Php 20,686 per month divided for 4 people is about 5k per month.  They plan to pay Php 28,000 per month though.

2/3 siblings don't have jobs yet (BIGGEST RED FLAG!), and their father is living off retirement money. All we have are estimates for income. 

**Income estimates per sibling :**

 * Before tax : Php 30,000 per month
 * After tax (30%) : Php 21,000 per month
 * After house payments : Php 14,000 per month

Food alone will take Php 9000 off per month (assuming Php 300 per day for 30 days, which is a generous assumption). Factoring in electricity, water, repairs, transportation, things start to turn scary.

I am advising against them getting a house this early on because 2/3 don't have jobs yet, and they still aren't aware of how big living expenses would be, and how much wiggle room they need to give themselves.

This is a really big decision and I think they're rushing it with the ""rent is dead money"" mindset. I told them paying 1M in interest is also dead money, but I'm finding it hard to convince them otherwise.

So, redditors, any advice?

Help estimating contribution amount into two investment accounts,"I have started two 529 accounts, one for each of my children. One child is ~4 years old while the other is 4 months old. I have chosen to invest into our state's tax advantaged accounts, which are run similar to target date funds for a 401k.

I would like to have roughly the same $ amount for each of them when they graduate high school. I realize that getting the exact same amount would be highly unlikely due to the age difference and variations in the investments over time. However, I feel as if I assumed an average return rate, I could estimate my monthly contribution to each account to try and keep things somewhat equal. Maybe not though, and maybe there's a better way to calculate this.


So, in summary I'm asking this:

I have a 4 year and 4 month old that each have a 529 investment account.

How to track the very specifics of my spending habits in the most effective way.,"I have been pulling bank statements off of the internet for the last few months and putting them in Excel. In Excel I work a little magic on them and I get the gist of were I'm spending my money. I want to break this down into categories, not just locations. I have found that hard at times because sometimes I buy things from multiple categories at a given location. So while i would set a budget for cloths, that is not to say that all I buy at Target (as the bank statement would say) is cloths.

I have decided that I am going to collect my receipts day by day and enter them into some kind of program in order to track exactly what I am spending on what and where.

I love the idea of using Excel for this as I am very comfortable with it. I was thinking though, would an Access database be better for this? I have used Access a little and read the whole Access Bible 2013, though i still have a hard time differentiating whether a Excel workbook or a Access database is better for a given task sometimes.

Also these are the two programs that I know of. Is there something else out there that would give me the same level of customization and track things down to the nitty gritty like i want to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3xxlcb/how_to_track_the_very_specifics_of_my_spending/,1450851104

Looking to attack my debt,"Hello PF,
    
Long time lurker. Long story short - at 26 I decided to attend to school to finish an accounting degree. Now at 28 - I graduate in about 2 weeks. I was originally a machinist for a family business that went down hill. I've worked as a waiter and day laborer to get myself through college, some loans were taken out.

Last August I moved back to my parents to save on rent - I was paying $750 a month and now pay $500 to still help my parents out and not feel like a freeloader while I returned to the nest and give me back that extra $250 and to finish off my last year. 

I have a job lined up in January to start full time from an internship where I was making 12$/hr to now 50k$ (plus two bonuses equaling about 5-8k) a year. I had two other offers, one located in NYC @ 55k and 1 that was an hour away for $46k at a trial position during tax season (no bennies or anything till I was put on full time.)

 I gladly took the job for 50k that was 20 minutes from my parents and I generally plan to live the same distance (30 minutes) from my new job. I plan on staying at my parents for the duration of tax season (April 15th) to really just save up and get ready to move out. I'd rather sooner than later, but I feel this is a smart idea as all accountants live in holes under their desks till the snow melt anyway. 


Since going to school I've wiped out ALL of my savings and the past few months i've been skating by okay with the occasional DIY car repair. I'd like to know the best way to handle my debt, plans to move out and purchase a new car:

DEBT
--
**Student Loans**

**32,150 @ 4.3%** - unsub/sub loans from the Fed Gov

**12,650 @ 10.75%** - Sallie Mae

**3,650   @ 8.80%** - Sallie Mae

--

--

**Credit Card Debt** - *Have 700 Credit rating - was at an abysmal 500 before going back to school. 

**$620** out of 750 @ 10% - Capital One (SECURED)

**$200** our of 300 @ 10% - Kohls 

--

At first glance I feel that entering the income driven repayment plan for my fed loans while consolidating with sofi and knocking out immediately the 19k in private seems like the proper game plan?

RENT
--

I make around 2900$ a month AFTER taxes (and health insurance cost coming out), being a little older it's a pain in ass to find a roommate anymore. Does $1000-1200 sound manageable for renting a 1BR? That's the rent for a decent place in the area where I live (all following the 30 minute commute criteria.) 

A lot of the place pay for all utils, how would I factor that into price? Or I should I really go hard into finding a roommate using roomster or craigslist?


CAR
--

My 2002 Wrangler has seen much better days, but living in the northeast has taken a large toll on the car. I've had it paid off for years and hoped it would last to this moment, but it probably only has one more winter till I have to decommission it just out of safety concerns, day by day it parts of it just make different noises.

 Most I could get for the car is probably $1000-2000 for the right owner. Anything from a subaru forester to a honda fit tickles my fancy. I am really leaning towards the fit, should I take advantage of a honda recent graduate program that is offering 0% financing and 5% down? Or go used?

 Looking for MPG and cargo room, I enjoy camping during the summer in NY State and the rest of the northeast. 

Other Job Things
--

Job will be paying for CPA with a 3k Bonus if I complete within a 18 month upon full time employment (which is the game plan), they offer 5% employer match with a safe harbor (basically I put in 1$ and they INSTANTLY match 5% of my salary) and then an additional and seperate 3% match is available. The bonuses are my flat rate over 40 hrs both given on May 31st Paycheck (the larger one from busy season) and the Dec. 31st Pay check.

[insurance] Can no longer afford insurance,"Okay... Long story short.

My wife was a school teacher but hated her life. At this time i was working full time and working on my degree. Well things flip flopped around and I ended up going to part time at work because I needed 50 credit hours to graduate and it was either get it done in one year or, because of prereqs, get it done in 2 1/2. After I moved to part time we got pregnant (planned) and my wife decided that she couldn't do the teaching thing anymore so she switched jobs. We were not thinking of the insurance implications. 


We went from $90 a month to $750 for the three of us... thats right $750. We tried to split it up because coverage for her and the baby is $340 and my employer will offer me insurance for $380. We still couldnt budget that. So i go to the healthcare.gov website and apply but because my employer offers coverage i get no discount. I am now officially paying $175 for the worlds worst insurance only to avoid paying premium increase on our house and car insurance as well as the stupid tax for not having any.

I continue to save a small amount from the state benefits each month but my potential for gaining wealth is very limited.

About a fortnight ago, I learned that my uncle and his daughter had died in a car crash and that my sister and I have inherited his estate; about £210,000 each. For context, my father (who died a few years back) had been estranged from his family since 2001; I haven't seen this uncle in over 15 years and have no recollection of him whatsoever so this inheritance is like the absurd ""great-aunt Matilda"" scenario you hear about in fiction. As my uncle's parents, brother and spouse are deceased, and his daughter (who should have inherited the estate) died in the same incident, my sister and I are his only living blood relatives.

I'll never see an influx of capital like this again - my career prospects are too precarious, my mother won't leave much inheritance and I'm too bright to play the lottery. If I structure my affairs responsibly, this is an opportunity to increase my quality of life, establish longer-term financial security and reduce my dependency on the state. The last thing I want to do is take this money and piss it down the drain which, incidentally, is exactly what my sister seems intent on doing.

I'm smart enough to know I need to save and invest but I'm not smart enough to know how to begin or what to do beyond ""max out an ISA"". That's why I've come to the wise side of reddit. I've read the sidebar links but am after advice considering my otherwise poor earning potential. I don't want to screw this up so any advice is truly appreciated: What should my next moves be bearing in mind that this may be the most money I'll ever have?

Thanks &lt;3

My husband(24) and I(21F) are really stupid. I feel like we'll never make it out of the hole we dug ourselves into. Can we get advice from smart people?,"We made some very poor decisions early in our marriage. We now have 3 repossessions, and about $15,000 in debt on our credit that has not been paid on at all in 2.5 years. (That is very embarrassing to write) my score is 505, don't know my husbands. 

Currently we are driving a 2004 Jetta we financed early this year for $3200. We will be paying it off with our tax refund this year. We just found out we are expecting our second child. Our Jetta will not hold two car seats. My husband is 6'5. He barely fits in the Jetta. Lol  

We currently live in a 2/2 800SF rental home. With two small dogs and a baby things are cramped. I really am content with where we live now, but with two children I want to have a place big enough for them to play, and we don't have a yard here.

We have nothing in savings. We make about 29000 annually before taxes combined. our rent, utilities, insurance, cell phone bill, internet, netflix and groceries come out to leave us with $400 a month leftover. I think we need to file bankruptcy. Is this the smart thing to do?

 A different car is a must. After paying off the Jetta we could sell it for maybe $2500(couple things wrong with it the shady dealer didn't disclose). I think we could save up about $1,000 between now and before the new baby arrives. When it comes time to buy a car we can either outright buy a $3,500 vehicle or perhaps find someway to finance a $7,500 car with 3,500 down.

I am scared to buy a cheap car outright because it will be our only vehicle to get to our jobs, and we'll be transporting very precious cargo to the babysitters every day.

Long story short I worked at a job that allowed me to live the lifestyle I have now earning over $2500/month: 

Monthly Bills

* -Rent (my portion)= $250
* -Utilities = $200
* -Car note = $400
* -Car insurance = $120
* -Credit card = $220
* -Cell = $70

However, the job I have now is making half of what I used to make at my previous job. I make close to $1700/month on a good month. Recent set backs such as being forced to buy new tires and a new battery for my car have forced me to be behind on my bills for the past few months. 

College is not an option for me. I've gone delinquent after dropping out 3 times. I can't get financial aid to go back. My credit has gone down considerably. My cat hates me.

Investment/Saving Plan w/Traditional or Roth Contribution Review,"Investment/Saving Plan w/Traditional or Roth Contribution Review
First, thank you in advance for taking the time to read this exhausting post.

Let’s starting with the basics: 
29/m, married, current salary $72K FERS-RAE and $6,168 ANG = $78K

28/f, spouse, current salary ~ $18K from local employment
*I met with a financial consultant at the end of 2014, we spent a few hours going over everything.  His major concern was that my rent was almost 40% of my take home pay but liked what I have so far established.

-8 years of ANG service, E5.  3yrs were active duty at E4
-3 years of FERS-RAE, GS11-4, purchased my 3yrs of military service back.
-2.2 years of OEF, reducing ANG pension collection to age 58


Current Contributions:
ANG: Traditional 7% | Roth: 7% - Bonus, Danger Pay, Special Pay = 10% but all prior contributions have been 100% or 50%

FERS: Traditional: 5% | Roth: 10%
Me: 1x monthly $500 transfer to savings
Spouse: 1x monthly $500 transfer to savings

Past TSP contributions have been
ANG: 10% Traditional, 100% Bonus
FERS: 10% Traditional, 5% match


Current Balances:
ANG: ~60K w/allocations C-S-I 40/20/40 – After lots of PF, bobblehead, MMM and FI reading, I should adjust I to 20%, hoping for a Santa Rally first.
FERS: ~34K w/same allocations – same thoughts - considering dropping my I allocation to 20 once there is a bit of a swing to recoup the $600 loss this year.

USAA: ~1K Roth IRA in a few foreign ETF that are not doing so well

USAA: ~1,500 in random MMJ stocks – also not doing well - now worth &lt;700

Joint Savings: $22K - considering DoC post on 5% savings accounts ; Primary Checking: $5K ; Secondary Checking: $5K ; CashBack Checking: $1,500
Wife is a foreign national, she has $10K worth of USD in home bank, a completely separate IRS headache.


Monthly Expenses:
Rent: $1288, unless I pay w/CC which is $1323 ; Grocery: ~$600 ; Metro/Bus: ~$200 ; Internet: $30 ; Mobile: $61 ; Netflix: $7.99 

We don’t eat out, the occasional food truck for lunch, we had 2 mini vacations and 1-10 day (expensive) but I dabble in the credit card game at r/churning to help mitigate the cost. Honestly, I haven't found where we can lean out even more of expenses.  I probably need to do YNAB to really track those misc charges.


Estimated Retirement Earnings/Pension

ANG 
6yrs of service for 2,080 points * 2.5 = 14.45% - I don’t think it will be any less than this

20yrs @ E6 = $3,724.20 * 14.45% = $538.1469 * 12 = $6,456

20yrs @ E5 = $3,125.70/m * 14.45% = $451.66365 * 12 = $5,412


FERS-RAE:
Early Retirement: 57 – there is a onetime window at age 55 to start collecting TSP w/out penalty.  If I’m still working with FERS, than I anticipate early retirement.
20yrs * 1% = 20% * $70,000 = $14,000

SSN Early Retirement, reduction in benefits?:

$1,000/m * 12 = $12,000 &amp; Spouse: Same?

DoD: $5,412
FERS: $14,000
SSN:   $24,000

= $43,412 + TSP Earnings + possible future overseas rental 

Married Filing Jointly: 15% &lt;73K and 25% &gt;73K &amp; $12,400 Standard deductions
***Does this mean we can make an AGI of 85K and the standard deductions will drop us down to 15%?

Current Estimated Earnings and Contributions:
Today I went down the rabbit whole of HDHP + HSA to see about the additional investment opportunities.  Since I can’t max out my TSP I didn’t think it was worth to follow through but I’ll share the data I was considering.  Both plans contribute $1,200 a year.  The minute I sign up my FSA is converted to a limited Expense FSA and can be used for Dental/Vision only.  2015 FSA contribution will be $500.  May end up using the FSA if this work related injury is not approved.

AETNA HDHP: $129/pp ($3,354) their HSA administrator is BNY Mellon that does have access to 3x Vanguard options VSCGX, VSMGX, VDAIX – the first two are mildly appetizing.  $2/m admin fee and 
GEHA HDHP: $116/pp, their administrator is HSA Bank and has access to TD Bank and Devenir investments w/no monthly fees
My current health plan is APWU for $110/pp ($2,860) that comes with a $2400 upfront PSA.  This has treated us pretty good minus their customer service and claim process. If you can tolerate this than it’s good.

I contributed $20/pp to an FSA to keep $500 in a rollover status.  I lowered 2016 contributions to $10/pp for $200
You can make it overly complicated and w/d HSA funds and pay for your own administrator to have access to much better Vanguard investment options but by now I’m just feeling overwhelmed. FEHB is the worst.

But seriously, what TSP method should I choose for 2016?  It seems important to keep our joint income in the 15% Fed and 5.75% State tax brackets. I could be wrong, please share
72K FERS + 6K DoD + 18K = $95,000
$95K - 12,400 = $82,000 - 73,000 = $9,000 difference 

THIS
Traditional: 14% = $338/pp = $10,000
Roth: 4% = $111/pp = $2,886

OR THIS ** What I'm 90% sure on
TR 20% = $553.80 ; Comparison - TR 15%: $415.35 / R 5%: $138.45  

Well thats everything, am I envisioning, calculating, and planning this correctly? What could I be doing better?

Planning to buy a condo and rent out second bedroom. How much to charge per month?,"Background: I'm currently looking to buy a condo close to work.  The condo HOA fees in the high-rises of the city where I work tend to range from $600-700 per month (all utilities included) depending on the size of the condo.  I am therefore looking to rent out the second bedroom to offset this cost.


One property I am looking at right now is a 1042 sq ft condo, with the second bedroom being 12ft by 10ft.  This condo is located ~4 miles away from where I work, and is in the city, close to the major highways.  The building itself is old - built in 1965.  Having toured the condo, I personally found the second bedroom to be a tad on the small side.   


Furthermore, there is only one small closet in that room, and no other storage spaces, and so the type of person I'd be renting out to would have to be someone with minimal personal belongings.  A graduate student working on completing their Ph.D. would be ideal.   


Given these factors - the small space (12x10 ft), the lack of storage (just the 1 small closet in the room), plus no in-unit washer/dryer in the condo (they'd have to use the shared laundry room), what would be a reasonable price to charge per month?

Alternatives to private student loans?,"I'm desperately trying to figure out how to pay for this upcoming semester (my college was paid for before but due to some poor academic decisions, this next semester is on me) and I looked into getting a private student loan because I don't qualify for FAFSA.

What. The. Fuck.

Is this the best I can do? In my eyes, that's just outrageous that I'm expected to pay almost triple what I'm asking for, and this is for ONE SEMESTER.

Girlfriend is 24 (almost 25) and is all of sudden ineligible for pell grants. What are her options?,"My girlfriend received an email from her academic adviser today informing her that she is no longer eligible for pell grants.

Used car buying for a college student,"Hi there guys,

Some six months back I was very stressed that I had about $4000 in credit card debt. Well, since then I sold my car for $4600 and paid off all my debt. I'm now debt free. I purchased my car in January of 2013 for $5000 so I only lost $400 plus the original title fee and taxes which were around $500. The problem, I now have no car. I'm commuting by bicycle now because I am attending school. 

However, I'm considering buying another used car and doing something similar. I graduate in about 12 months and probably won't be keeping the car for more than 18. 

I'm wanting a new car mostly for convenience but partly because I can't commute to my summer internships on a bicycle. 

My thoughts are to do what i did before. Buy a car for around $5000 and then sell for whatever the value of the car is after those 18 months. Now, I have a lot of car dealer acquaintances that help me get cheap cars from dealer only auctions. I buy these cars for around $1500 under their street value. 

I'm currently looking at a 2012 Kia Forte that I can get for around $1500 under the actual value. I'm planning on using a personal line of credit that has an APR of 9.7% to buy it. I would be making monthly payments until I sell it at which point I would pay of the balance on the loan.

After losing money because of interest and assuming the car devalues $1500 over those 18 months (it will devalue slowly because the price is already near its floor) I would be looking at the equivalent of leasing the car for $70/month with no lease terms or restrictions since I will technically own the car. 

What do you say personal finance? Is this a wise move for someone that can easily afford that now but has no guarantee of maintaining this level of financial security.

University Application Problems,"A little backstory, I'm currently 17 maintaining a 4.0 GPA. I have taken a couple free college classes through a special program at my high school. I am currently planning on getting my bachelors at UCSB for Actuarial Science, but I missed the deadline for a very key reason: I had no SAT score, and I won't have one until the 22nd. I know for a fact that I scored around the 2100-2200 range on my SATs, which obviously satisfies that requirement of the school. I COULD NOT take the SATs before Dec 5, due to family emergencies and other miscellaneous events and problems. I am here because I am faced with a key decision that will impact the rest of my life.

Choice 1:
---
I contact the school and hopefully get time to send in my application, but risk being offered minimal support in terms of financial aid. Keep in mind I am a high-achieving student in a family that makes less than 15k a year before taxes. I've read up on my situation and it looks as if I would be at the bottom of the pile for aid if I got my application in.
  
Choice 2:
---
I choose another school, one that gives me time to apply before the deadline. This is where I could use some help. I don't know of many schools that offer Actuarial Science, especially ones that still have applications open now.  
  
Choice 3:
---
I stay in my home town and go to community college for a year, using a program at my school to hold my diploma, allowing me to get free schooling for a year, and then I transfer to UCSB.

Grad school reimbursed by employer in 2 years. Should I take out loans or use savings to pay tuition now? How should I repay loans?,"I'm in a one year, full-time graduate program. I graduate in May. In September I will start work at my previous employer.  My employer will pay for my tuition in two lump sums over the next two years. I've already taken out some loans, but want to know if I should take out more or pay with my savings.  

Total tuition will be around $92k. I pay for living expenses from savings.  Besides my 401k, I have $66k invested in index funds and $50k in cash savings (recently received my signing bonus). I have taken out $21k in Direct Stafford Unsubsidized Federal Loans (5.84% interest), $12k in Federal Perkins Loans (5% interest), and $29k in loans from my family (0% interest). 

That leaves $30k left of tuition that I need to pay. I can take out an additional $21k in Fed Unsubsidized Loans and $4k in Perkins.  

How should I repay my loans?  Minimum monthly payments or pay off as much as I can as quickly as possible?  Which loans do I prioritize first? I am reimbursed by my employer in two lump sums (after one year and after two years). Do I allocate all those payments to my loans?

"Question about renting. Landlord doesn't ""need"" to do walkthrough before moving in.","Hi PF,

Not sure if this is the correct sub, as the title says, I ask my landlord to do a walking before moving in and he replied ""We dont do walkthrough, you usually move in and let us know what is wrong and we fix it"". Is this to my advantage or no?


Also on another note, I'm supposed to get the apartment in 2 weeks but the landlord wants both deposit and first month rent when I sign the lease this Friday. Is this normal practice? My past experience were always ""deposit"" at signing and first month of rent when moving in on the first day.

"Need help paying off $126,000 in Student Loans","Hey Everyone,

So I have a ton of student debt that I need to pay off and I am really nervous about how much debt I had accumulated. Most of the loans are from private loans and then about $30,000 of the loans are Federal Loans. 

The loan interest rate average is 8.5%. I was thinking about doing a loan refinance through a company like Sofi. It says that the interest rates can be as low as 3%. 

Ideally, I'd like to pay off my loans in 10 years but I don't even know if that's possible. I really need a plan to get rid of all this debt. 

I am 23 and I just graduated college.  I was fortunate enough to immediately get a job. I make around $70,000 a year. My take home paycheck every two weeks is around $1,700 because I contribute 6% to my 401k. I don't pay rent because I live with my parents. The following is an estimate of my expenses:

* Gym - $125 (It's a lot because I have a boxing gym that is $99 a month and a weightlifting gym that is $35)
* Groceries - $160
* Gas - $80
* Phone - $40
* Eating Out - $100

I really don't go out much so my expenses aren't too high. I mainly spend money on food and fitness. I just started my job so I really haven't gotten a good look at what my true budgets will be with this pay but I don't think I'll change my spending habbits at all. 

What do you all suggest I do so I can pay this student loan debt?

Opening a Second Bank Account for Bills only - Bad Idea?,"Hi, there, PF!

I may have read this here, or heard about it elsewhere, or hell, maybe I made it up. But, I am going to detail out my plan and I want your genius opinions on whether it's a bad or good idea.

My husband and I have one bank account currently with an attached savings. Admittedly, we have previously been pretty bad at budgeting and saving. To try to combat this and begin to save more and pay all bills on time and in the right amounts I want to open a second bank account (with the same bank? Different bank?). I would set up a recurring (weekly, on our Payday) transfer from our main account (where our paychecks are deposited into) for the total amount of all recurring bills divided by four, which in our case, is a little under $600/week. I would then set up all of our bills for automatic payment out of the secondary account.

Any money leftover in our main account would set aside for savings and for groceries, fuel and spending money.

T. Rowe Price retirement funds drop 6-7% in one day while all holdings only dropped 1%-2% with the market. Why?,"I noticed my 401k balance drop way more than expected this weekend so I decided to look into it and I'm confused. I'm 100% invested in TRRKX which is their target date retirement fund year 2045. The fund dropped 6.5% Friday and I decided to see what caused the large drop.

When I looked into all of the holdings in the fund, none of them fell more than 2%. If this is the case, how can the fund drop more than any of the holding it is made up of? Is this a re-balancing issue that will work itself out on Monday? Every chart or quote I check all show the same change as well as other various TRP target dated retirement funds showing larger drops than their holdings show. I must be missing something..?

[Update] 400k suddenly in my bank account since 3 days ago. Please advise on what I should do. Kinda scared.,"Edit

[Daily Mail Article](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3342060/Reddit-user-22-shocked-400-000-mysteriously-appears-bank-account.html)
^lol, thanks daily mail

Also, thank you for gilding!

----------------------

Firstly, thanks to all helpful and constructive comments! It should be mentioned that it is part of the reddiqutte to follow the subreddit rules.

Onto the update. 

Long story short, the bank called. An employee had accidentally transferred a home loan funds into my account!
From many redditors, if it was a customer error, legally I would be able to keep the money (not implying that I would). But if it were a bank error, they could take it - no questions asked (info from several redditors who worked in a bank).


They called me that they will reverse the original transaction, and to move the money into my original account because I had moved it into a new account so that I could distinguish between 'that' money and my money.


It took under 5 minutes. Very anti-climatic, but better than a lawsuit! Thank goodness that the stress is over.


Also, since it is a new month (today is 1/12/15, Australia), a credit interest had occurred in my account and they didn't take that either. Since the money was in that other account for one day it got about $25 credit interest. 

So... essentially, I got out more than what I initially had woo (-:

I think I'll just let it sit there for the memories. Haha.


--


I learnt a lot of things from this as well. (Remember this is from Australia, and could be from the UK as well, because we do apply UK's common laws to Aus...maybe...IANAL)


- *Unjust Enrichment*: In law, unjust enrichment is where one person is unjustly or by chance enriched at the expense of another, and an obligation to make restitution arises, regardless of liability for wrongdoing. (Scary!)


- *Change of Position*: Change of position is a defense to a claim of unjust enrichment, or for restitution. Ordinarily, someone who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another is strictly liable to disgorge his gains. However, a ""change of position"" defense operates where it would be inequitable to compel him to make restitution. (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/m06n7/whats_the_best_legal_loophole_you_know/c2wzyy1 - thanks to /u/pspins for the link)


- *Theft by finding*: Theft by finding occurs when someone who chances upon an object which seems abandoned takes possession of the object but fails to take steps to establish whether the object is abandoned and not merely lost or unattended. In some jurisdictions the crime is called ""larceny by finding"" or ""stealing by finding"".


There were lots of very unethical things I could do, but I had no desire to do that (this has to be established and said, apparently).
In conclusion, do not take money that's not yours.


Thank you for all your help, PF!

Desperate for money,"Hi there, 
A bit of background. I am 26 and decided after 2 years in the workforce to go back for my Master's. This took me to Colorado. I have car payments from the car I bought right out of undergrad,  cell phone, credit card I use for gas,  and I work part time as an Athletic Trainer making 9k a year. I took out a student loan to cover everything but only got approved for roughly half what I requested and that got split up over the scholastic year so I am trying to stretch 1/4 of what I asked for. 

Where can I get more money? I don't have the time to get another job. Is a personal loan from a lending institution a viable option? My credit score is in the high 600's",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3v41zk/desperate_for_money/,1449039381
I need first time home buying advice/life advice,"I will start off by saying that I am traditionally extremely frugal and I have always looked for ways to save money, so this is one factor I am looking to accomplish but not necessarily. I tried college and dropped out my first year to join the military. I have saved up a small sum ($15k) most of which is in large cap stocks right now but is essentially liquid. I am within 6 months of my enlistment expiration and have so many options that I almost wish I didn't because I've always found commitment and choosing very difficult but I need to make a choice for my future. Basically these are my options

*I can move back home. This would be the ""safest"" option. My parent lives a mile from a state college and I could go there for free while collecting BAH and such. The main negative is 1. living with my parent and 2. I am afraid that I'll get stuck in that town. I'm already out and there are not a lot of jobs there and I don't want to get stuck there with no options.

*My second option is staying in the military. In reality, this is not much of an option. It would be the best for money but I don't really like the way that it seems to be headed. The money in the Military is actually really good. I take home $30k a year at 23 with no debt or insurance and lots of freebies. I just can't stand the life anymore and the vibes around the place.

*This is my main option right now. I would like to take my money and settle down. I live across the USA from my hometown and I like it here. The problem is that house prices are pretty steep. We're looking at $200-300k for a 3b-2.5ba and such. My credit score is 750 so I don't think I will have a problem actually purchasing a house, I just want to make sure it's not a horrible choice before I do. The main factor that is pushing me towards yes is that I have 3 friends (stepbrother-girlfriend and her sister) that live out here and would be able to move in and support the mortgage almost instantly. I am not worried about them at all, they are solid. I am worried about the possibility that I get out and am unable to find a job to support all of the taxes, insurance etc. 

*Finally, renting. I don't want to rent. I've always hated paying anyone money whether it be financing or renting. I realize that is exactly what I am considering doing but I think I can get my friends to pay a majority of the mortgage. I am just unsure.

Edit. I will be receiving around $1300/month in housing allowances through the GI bill if I buy a house and give another go at college.

So there I am. Stuck with options and not sure what I want to do. Any advice at all would be appreciated. I've read most of the internet articles on renting vs buying and I realize I don't have %20 to put down but VA loans have no insurance costs so that's another tidbit. Sorry for the rambling. TIA

Can someone explain the HSA vs PPO to me?,"When I started my job 18 months ago, I thought our HR had an agenda when she told me ""a young healthy person like you should do a HSA"". She always has an agenda. And she does not know my healthcare needs. So I took what I thought was the best option, the PPO or ""regular"" insurance.

Last week I had a small accident and had to go to the ER just to be sure I was ok. I am. $300 to visit the ER was a financial setback but not a catastrophe.

So now my boss asks why I had not set up an HSA. He then tells me you can have a savings account that is tax-free AND have traditional insurance.

Then my other co-worker tries to explain that PPO is a lower deductible plan. But that maybe with an HSA if I plan, save and stay healthy it might be cheaper....

But I visit a specialist at least once a year, so I think gambling on my health is probably a bad idea.

PA Use Tax Laws (specifically for Aircraft),"Back in 2013 I had a very defunct Cessna aircraft left to me when my father passed.  

I live near Chicago, and registered the airplane at my mothers house in PA, which I figured would be easier than to change address every time I move.  

Almost IMMEDIATELY after I had the plane transferred to me, PA had their hand out looking for tax money.   I called to explain the aircraft was left to me, I paid nothing for it and that I could prove that with some documentation from my lawyer.   They accepted this and I paid no tax on the plane.

I figured instead of scrapping it, I would get it airworthy again.  After more money than I care to think about, I got the plane legal and flying.  Now I have this extremely expensive toy sucking my bank account dry, so I decide to lease the plane to a flight school.

I transfer the ownership of the airplane from myself to an S-Corp that I created to insulate myself legally.  I sold the aircraft to myself for $1 and other valuables considered. 

Now PA is back demanding more taxes, since I had to transfer the aircraft to the S-Corp, they figure I need to pay taxes on the value of the plane, est to be around 55-60k.  So, $3600 dollars in taxes.

The folks i spoke to on the phone in Harrisburg didn't really seem to know what they were talking about.  She had to keep deferring to a supervisor and came back with non-answers to my questions... so before I hemorrhage even more money because of this airplane, I need to make sure I pay the right amount. 

I'll start here first, I'm not sure if there's a tax attorney in PA I could talk to or where to start.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yog8o/pa_use_tax_laws_specifically_for_aircraft/,1451412114
How do missed timecards affect tax rates?,"Hi, I just finished a four month internship in the U.S. I was paid on a bimonthly cycle based on timecards that were punched in. Towards the end, I missed submitting my timecard for two straight pay cycles. As a result, in the next pay cycle, I received a gross income for one and a half month of work. 

The problem is that for some reason, this income was taxed much more (42%) compared to the usual 25% I get deducted every two weeks. After talking to Payroll, they said I may have been put into a higher tax bracket, but is this a mistake? Should I pursue Payroll and try to make them amend this, or is it just something that I have to wait for until I file my tax return? I hope someone can help! Thanks. 

On an additional note, I also made the mistake of claiming 0 allowances on my W4 form, when I was supposed to claim 2. Will I still have a chance to claim these allowances on my tax return, or is it too late?

The officer charged me with careless driving and when i went to court and showed the maintenance records and the mechanics report on the vehicle everything was dropped..

Even though we had a report from another private mechanic that the electronic power assist had failed. Gm however were willing to cover our deductible all out of pocket costs and the lawyer fees... now that the court trial is over i have the lawyer fees total and now a bill from the city for the hydro pole the claims adjuster for gm has ignored my emails and calls for over a month even though she updates her voicemail on a daily basis i have yet to get a response.. i dont know if i should post this on facebook or twitter on gm’s page so hopefully reddit can help! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3x80p5/general_motors_canada_owes_me_a_few_thousand/,1450365483

Is getting a home equity loan for a second home a good idea in my situation?,"Here's my situation. My parents retired and transferred the ownership of their house to under my name. They and the rest of the family now live there and maintain the place while I pay for the remaining mortgage. My job's in another city so I'm also paying rent on an apartment. 

My parents are suggesting that I take a home equity loan on the house to serve as a down payment on a second home or condo so that I don't have to continue to pay rent. I hesitate to do this since I know very little about home equity loans and the idea of basically having two mortgages is kind of daunting, especially when the first home will not be generating any income. 

I'm curious if this is a good idea, and if there are any pitfalls that I should be aware of before going into something like this. 


Some Background: 
 
 * The house is valued at a little over $500,000 with about $200,000 remaining on the mortgage, which is at 4%. 



 * The second home would be in the southern California where I work, so I'm guessing at a minimum I would need about $60,000 (realistically probably more) for the second home or condo's 20% down payment.  



 * I currently have about a $30,000 emergency fund that I can dip into to fill any gaps for the down payment, closing costs, etc. 



 * The current rent on my apartment is about $900 a month. My current income is such that I can afford to few hundred extra a month for the mortgage that would most likely be higher than that. 




Any tips or thoughts would be appreciated. Many thanks.



**EDIT:** To answer a couple of the questions I've gotten...

 * Parents aren't pressuring me to buy versus rent: It's actually my idea. Before my current job I spent about 10 years in school and moving around and doing various contract work so I'm ready to settle down at this point, but only if it's financially feasible (which is one of the reasons I'm asking these questions). My current job has been stable for the last 2-3 years (knock on wood) so that's why I'm giving this some consideration now.



 * My mom is dealing with a battery of health problems and will probably need to be taken care of for the rest of her life, so I'm helping out and covering their living costs. Both my parents receive some state assistance so they can cover most of their living expenses like food, utilities, etc.

"[Help] Cheque I wrote to UPS bounced, need help","Okay, so I wrote a cheque to UPS for $11.99 to cover import charges. I transfer money to my chequeing ccount a day in advance of the cheque being cashed to ensure it gets paid (18 years old, trying to keep my savings account high).

 Despite my statement clearly showing the transfer going through before the cheque is cashed, it bounces and I'm charged with an insufficient funds fee. 

I emailed UPS saying I'd pay them the $11.99 I owe them, and I'll call my bank once I can to figure out what the hell is going on.

Will my application for a mortgage be affected by where the money came from (Insurance settlement).,"I was pre-approved for a mortgage on a house.  I received an insurance settlement that has allowed me to pay off all student loans, and fully fund my emergency fund.  My wife currently owns our house (bought it before we were married), and we are planning on renting it out (Should get $1500 based on comps, the mortgage is about $900).

We have enough for a 20% down payment, and were pre-approved at $250k just based on my income and DTI ratio, etc.

My question is will the lender not look well on me as an applicant since the settlement happened in early Nov? So obviously my checking/savings accounts show a dramatic change, as well as my debt reduction.

We've always been frugal, and we can afford the mortgage pretty easily even just based on how we live.

Questions about consolidating debt.,"Hey /r/personalfinance. I'm 23 and married. My husband is amazing and has perfect credit. His score is above 800, if that matters. We both make $30,000 a year before taxes. I have read pretty much every post in the history of /r/personalfinance about consolidation. 

I used to have a 580 credit score but with his help in the last 6 months we've brought it up to a 620.

I'll show our monthly budget and what all of my debt is:


- Rent - $1,000
- Cell phones - $150
- Electricity - $75
- Cable &amp; internet - $100
- Car payment - $150
- Car insurance - $220 
- Furniture (we pay installments) - $50
- Best Buy (for our TV) - $50
- Personal spending money - $80 for us each
- My student loan payments - $50
- My health insurance - $50
- Groceries ($60 a week) - $240
- Netflix - $8
- Pass to wash car - $14
- Gas ($40 to fill up every week) - $160
- Eat out - $100

The rest of the money is either put into savings, or we'll pay off something entirely that we've been paying on in installments. Yesterday we paid off a mattress that we had $200 left on. In November we paid off our tires that we owed $500 on. 

My husband has multiple credit cards that he doesn't owe anything on, he pays them off on time every month. He got me a credit card that he monitors. I can only use it for things like gas, groceries, etc. He pays that credit card off every month on time.

My husband has no debt other than things that we pay off in installments (if that is counted as debt, which I believe it is) and has nothing in collections. I have 5 things in collections, and each one was from before I was married:

- $3,600 to an apartment complex that my best friend and I lived in. We were both on the lease, my friend bailed and then I was laid off from my job a few days later. I had savings but it didn't help much. I couldn't pay the rent for two months and did my best to find a roommate but couldn't. I was behind two months in rent, which was $1,200 per month. Once this showed up on my credit it was somehow $3,600, which I don't understand. This same charge is also on my friend's credit and it shows up as a ""joint"" collection.

- $100 to an insurance company I have never heard of. I've disputed it as of yesterday but my car insurance (previous to getting married) was always under my grandfather's name and was paid by him. He is very strict about bills so I am 100% sure this wasn't because of him.

- $200 to Time Warner Cable that I never paid. No excuse for this, I was just irresponsible. 

- ~~$100 for a doctor's appointment I went to but had insurance at the time that covered it. This will be taken off as it is a billing error by the company and I am working with them at the moment.~~ **I just got confirmation from the billing department that this has been removed from my credit!**

- $690 to an electric company from when I was living in the same apartment complex that I owe a lot of money to. I couldn't afford to pay, and the bill just kept getting higher and higher.


Now, I understand how irresponsible I was and just want to fix all of this. My husband and I want to buy a house in the next ~3 years and with the way my credit is, who the hell would let me buy a house? So we had the idea of doing a balance transfer. 

**Two questions:** 
My husband qualifies for a 21 month, balance transfer with a credit card from Citi. He is pre-approved. So we're going to use some of our savings to knock off more bills and cut cable so that we can pay towards this balance transfer each month. Is this a good idea? If my friend can pay half of her $3,600 that she owes, we're looking at $98 per month. 

My second question: My friend owes half of the $3,600 credit that I do. How do I go about this? I was thinking about sitting down with her and asking that she pay it and I'll pay it as well. It's win-win and she's *much* more mature now so I think she would agree. If not, I understand that I am stuck with all of it. My husband thinks we should take her to court over it, but I know that's not the answer. No judge will make her pay half, I signed the lease just like she did. Unless I'm wrong?

Opening a foreign Savings Account? (UK/CAN),"Hi guys, looking for a bit of good advice here. I live in the UK and I would like to open a bank account in Canada to keep some of my savings in. I visit Canada regularly but the reason for this account would be to save towards a deposit on a property (if my partner and I decide to immigrate in the next few years, or failing that just to buy as a holiday home or rental property). I also have money in a Cash ISA in the UK which I need to move as I will be closing that account soon. 
Is there any sense in doing this or is it a stupid idea to have savings in an overseas account, in a foreign bank account? 
The second part of my question I suppose is, which banks/accounts are best for me? I'd be looking to manage it using online banking and depositing a set amount each month, but I'd like to be able to withdraw my savings easily to my British current account should I need it in case of emergency.

"Closing on a home loan, can I get a sanity check on the closing costs?","Some quick background:

This is an in-family sale (non-arms length) that we are using to officially transfer title on a property held by a deceased grandparent's trust.

We are officially buying the property at appraised value ($140k, loan for $112k), but essentially no money will change hands, so it functions more as a refinance. 

We are getting the loan through a broker who has mostly been very helpful and educational.  One of the things he stated up front was that he gets paid by the lender, not by us, for bringing them the business. 

Yet, lo and behold, come closing time I see two line items, one for Origination Fee and one for Underwriting Fee, totalling about $2700. 

Does this seem inconsistent with his initial statement?  Should I push back and ask the lender to pay origination fees?

Also, officially on the document it shows the seller paying closing costs, and has an additional ""Principal Reduction -- Excess Rate Credit"" listed as paid by the lender.  I'm not sure what this item is referring to; is it because the seller credit was too high? too low?

[Here's a screenshot](http://imgur.com/a/0cjNp) of the closing costs (no personal information)

Now, I'm in a bit of a pinch, as I need a car and want to buy, but would rather not have the 300+/month payment as my fiancée has one as well. I don't see this car as a ""permanent car"" and might be more of a stop-gap situation (as I'm near a new job, making about $20,000 more per year, and would mind owning something newer/nicer).

Things that aren't super important to me: Low mileage leases (we have two cars, wouldn't be using this for long trips). I've been told to look out for purchase options and ""lease locking"", where they require you to lease again from them in the future.

Options for getting rid of private mortgage insurance.,"Hello All-

I currently own a house with a market value of $250,000. My mortgage is $212,000 (orig. $215,000). I have paid on the 1st of the month for 9 straight months now and have a credit score in the mid-700s. However, my mortgage requires a $100 PMI premium monthly. I received a letter from the bank (which I guess gets sent annually) indicating that I have a right to request and removal of mortgage insurance when my loan drops to 80% of the market value.

I make a solid income, but there is just no way I can pay down on my mortgage fast enough to get a loan to market value of 80% before another 12-18 months, meaning probably shelling out approximately $2,000 in PMI premiums in total. I just don't see myself as high risk, having good income, reasonable equity (15%), in a very strong real-estate market.

Do I have any other options to have my PMI requirement dropped? Does asking nicely work at all?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3weqcp/options_for_getting_rid_of_private_mortgage/,1449858804

I've gone through the .gov website and the cheapest for just pure shit is 182 a month. I am a science major and I'm taking 16 hours of class and have a mandatory 20 extra hours in the lab unpaid. With studying I don't have time to work more, especially since it seems that the 182 is just down the drain unless something terrible happens but then I still need to pony up $8500 before they apy for anything at all.

I've looked at the University insurance but I didn't have the money for it at the time (lump sum up front) and it really isn't much cheaper. I guess is there anything I can really do here to either not pay the fee or is there some insurance option I'm not seeing?

Retirement/ IRA question,"Hello everyone, 

My dilemma is that I had opened a Roth IRA at my bank when I first started working and I didn't read the fee amount (yes very dumb but I was new to being an adult and now I read everything) and I did the math and saw that if I contributed the maximum amount each year it would take 8 years to break even on the fees, and I basically earn more with my basic savings account. I want to close this account out or transfer it to another type of retirement account because I'm just going to lose money here. 

My question is basically what implications, if any, will there be in terms of taxes/ future retirement benefits if I was to close this account and move it to my savings or if I transferred it to some other retirement account? I remember that there was some issues with pulling IRA funds early but besides a $25 bank fee I don't know what the implications are as this was post-tax money so hopefully you all can help!

I opened my Chase card in mid August and my Target card about a month after. I make all my payments on time and never spend more than I have. I bike to work so gas payments are very minimal and I save a bit on groceries at the moment because my parents insist I share their joint Costco AMEX card (thanks mom/dad). 


I've been taking advantage of Chase's rotating categories so most of my purchases so far have been through Amazon, but I also like to shop there as it is convenient. 

Here are some of the options I was looking at:
Amazon Visa - 3% from Amazon and $50 bonus. Awesome, Amazon is convenient for me to shop through. 


Citi Double Cash and Fidelity AMEX - 2% cashback for general everyday purchases. However, I'm weighing how long it would take me to spend $20k vs the immediate bonus of a Capital One card for instance. I'll break down my spending patterns below. 


Discover IT - 5% rotating, but it seems to match Chase's categories as well. Has an insane cashback percentage through end of the year with Apple Pay though? 


Capital One Quiksilver - 1.5% cashback and $100 sign up bonus seems great as well as no foreign transactions (not sure if I'll be taking that trip though) 


Sally Mae UPromise - what's the difference between this and the Barclays that everyone talks about? The Barclays was very interesting to me with the Amazon cashback but it seems this is discontinued and the UPromise is not as good. But I was reading the rewards and it honestly looks similar? 


AMEX Blue Cash Everyday - $150 sign up bonus right now and some decent cashback rates. Not seeing what the drawback would be here. 


AARP Credit Card - $100 sign up bonus, decent categories for cashback. 


Visa Signature by TruWest - $100 sign up bonus and 1.5% back on everything, mirrors the Capital One Quiksilver without the no foreign transactions fees? So Capital One would have more utility? 


Did a lot of searching on Reddit and NerdWallet to come through to this list, but I think my top considerations would be Amazon, Capital One, Citi, or Discover. Sallie Mae UPromise would be my choice, but it's different now? The others seem to be outweighed by others in the list unless I was missing something. 


Some of my spending patterns since beginning of September. A lot of dining purchases involved me fronting the bill and being paid in cash, but this would also be cashback for me. 


Amazon purchases - $450


Clothes (including gifts) - $860


Eating out - $1200


Fast Food (not a subset of eating out, I categorized this the best I could from sit down restaurants)- $300


Groceries - $475

"Finally hired on, don't know my reasoning is adequate for a pay increase.","Recently my boss dropped off the paperwork to bring me on as a full-time employee.

Am I doing things correctly? (CAN) Lots of questions.,"Hello everyone, 

So a little background. I am semi disabled Military Vet. I served for 5 1/2 years before I was released due to my medical situation which arose from a service related injury. 

Before release I was making 75K before taxes. Now as part of my release plan, and disability plan I make 75% of that for 2 years. One year has already gone by. I was awarded a lump sum tax free disability payment of 64K, which I accepted. This also gives me lifetime medical coverage FOR ONLY the condition for which I was awarded the claim. 

The injury destroyed both my l5/s1 nerve in my lower spine. As a result I have lost most muscle mass in the muscles that these nerves control, mostly on my left side. As a result I have serve nero pain 24/7 and I have developed something called complex regional pain syndrome which is effecting many muscle and nerve groups in my lower body. There is no cure or rehab possible for such an injury. As a result I take morphine daily, which has the side effect of making me very ill. I walk with a cane as well.

So to the $ side of things. I have maxed both my RRSP/ TFSA so far. The majority of both are invested in TD Canada Trust E series Index funds at a 60/40 split between equities and bonds. 

$30,000 is in a self directed RRSP which I run through TD, which holds the e series funds. $15,500 is in a TFSA of the same funds also controlled by me. 

16k (TFSA) is located in a mutual fund which was set up for me with a financial adviser. I do not like this fund very much the MER is around 2% and it contains basically all the things covered under a CND index fund, which I own, and which has out performed the fund over 2 years, and has an MER of .8%

I have 11K in a savings account as a emergency fund. ( TFSA)

My SO takes home $2100 each month after taxes and I make $3100 after taxes from my disability pension. 

We have zero debt with the exception of a lease payment of $251 a month @ 0% for a yaris which is our DD. Monthly fixed expenses which includes food are $3100 which includes rent of $1500. We live in an expensive city to buy housing, so much so that I think the market is 20% over valued. We live near downtown where my SO works so zero travel time to work. He job is a government related one and she is doing well so we think her job security is strong. She has a savings account which I do not control with around 15K in it, earning nothing. She is super lose averse so talking her into investing it has not worked. 

We have a second car, a sports car which is paid for. I don't drive it much but when I do it gives me great joy and I don't want to sell it. She cannot drive a stick so it does not get used all that much. 

I am currently studying to become a CPA, which is paid for by Veterans Affairs, up to 28K but I only have 2 years to get as much done as possible.  I already have a degree, although it is a useless social science one. 

So now the questions. I have 50K in my checking account right now, I don't know what to do with it. Purchase more index funds in a non tax sheltered way? Move the low earning savings account out of a TFSA and into a standard account?

Look at other investments? 

Housing? I don't want to purchase a house in a peak market, and I don't know if I will have income after 1 year. There is  chance I will stay on my pension but that's up to veterans affairs to decide in 1 year. As of right now I can tell you I will be unable to hold any sort of work. I have 3-4 doctors appointments per week, the medication has drastic side effects which knock me out, and some days I cannot leave the house. No one will hire me knowing that.

I assume I am doing OK in relation to other people my age ( 30) but I just feel so overwhelmed trying to manage this stuff alone. Not only that everyone I speak to in the financial industry tries to fuck me over. ""here buy this fund which has an MER of 3.5%!"" FUCK THAT.

What kind of car can I afford on a roughly 50k a year salary?,"Before I start, I want to make it very clear that I wont be making a major purchase like this for a little while now, but I would still like to get a financial goal in place.

I am 22, and I am currently driving an 02 sonata which still works fine... for now. But it wont always, hence my planning ahead. 

-some facts-

I already contribute 4% to a 401k match.

I currently have about 13k in student loans, but since I am living at home, these will be paid off by June or July. From there, I will start saving for both an emergency fund and for a car before I move out. 

I would like to buy a new car. Maybe a new civic or another sonata.

I would plan on putting down a rather large down payment to minimize the time / money for my recurring payments. 

I have a very good credit score, sitting currently around 780, and i presume it would only go up by the time I would have to apply for an auto loan. 

Monthly, I would have roughly 1800 post tax dollars to play with for everything (rent, car loan, groceries, etc)

Does this sound feasible? I can provide more information if necessary. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3w3tkb/what_kind_of_car_can_i_afford_on_a_roughly_50k_a/,1449685775
[Auto] Just found out my buddy pays $90 for full coverage on his leased car. I'm paying $220 for full coverage on my leased car. What am i doing wrong?,"We are the same age. Bank through the same credit union, both insure through geico. I'm not sure why i'm paying so much more than him. I drive a Kia Forte and he drives a toyota rav4. Both cars are 2011. And neither vehicles have been paid off though his car was almost twice as expensive as mine. Is there anything i can do to lower my insurance costs? I've only been in one accident and i got rear-ended so it wasn't even my fault. Also we each are on our own insurance policy. I dont understand how our bills are so different despite the fact that our situations are exceedingly similar.

Is late payment a benefit of 0% APR card?,"So, perhaps the title sounds naive, and I guess it is a bit. 

I recently got a second credit card as part of a meeting with my bank just because I figured it would help in the long run, plus I do banking with them, might as well have a credit card with them too, so eventually I can get rid of the other one. 

The current limit of the first card (Capital One) is $2,300 (I'm 19, so I think it's pretty okay). The one I got from Bank of America has a $1,200 limit. Right now, I don't have much in the Bank of America card, but I do have a promotional 0% APR on it. With the bill due in January, I usually just pay all my debts in installments every week. My question is more hypothetical, since I have never paid late, and it  is that since it has 0% APR, would the benefit only be that if I pay late, there would be no accrued interest fees on it? Or would it also not hurt my credit score? I'm leaning towards that it would, but would love someone more knowledgeable than I to give input.

[USA] How to avoid student loans going into College,"Hello /r/personalfinance!

I am currently a Senior in High School who is well on their way on the both exciting and awful college process. I have already been accepted into the college of my choice and now I am looking to figure out how to get through it without crippling debt (preferably with no debt at all). I am VERY scared of all the student loan horror stories and people with a hundred thousand dollars of student loans.

Currently I am planning on attending Elizabethtown College, in Elizabethtown Pennsylvania. The total cost of tuition would be around $48,000 per year (yikes). However I have received a $28,000 scholarship per year assuming I stay at the school and keep a decent GPA. I do NOT qualify for any need-based financial aid. I'm planning on majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in business. The percentage of having a job within 6-months of graduation from E-Town is 79% and the average starting salary for a Computer Engineering Major is about $65k/yr. 

So here's everything nice and organized.


**Costs**
Tuition- 48,000/yr  Total: 192,000
Room&amp;Board- 6,000 Total: 24,000


**Money(Don't know proper term)**

Scholarship- 28000 Total:112,000
(Bringing total tuition down to 20,000 per year and total to 80,000) 
Parents- 55k, but they will pay for most of my other expenses

Job During College- ??? (Probably wont work more than 20 hours a week)
Job During Summer- 2.5k (Thats how much i've made last 2 years and unless I get a raise thats the number)

Savings- ~8k (Not very good at saving ;-; I like to spend money)

So that leaves me with **$31,000** of total money I don't have.



So to the bright minds of /r/personalfinace how should I go about this! I know my problem isn't as bad as most people, but i'm totally losing my shit about this. I want to make sure I get everything sorted out before I have to pay my admission fee and all of that.


Edit: I can't do math.

Additional Edit: I am set on this school, I don't want to turn them down unless it's absolutely necessary. I have alot of friends that go there and I really like almost everything about it.


Edit #3: Alot of people are saying community college, however I don't get my scholarship if I go somewhere else first 2 years. The scholarship makes my tuition 20k/yr which is on par with cheaper schools.

Mother cosigned on a vehicle that was repossessed - she was offered a settlement but has been advised against taking it by family.,"Hello all,

My mother cosigned a vehicle note that was later repossessed with her being held fully responsible. It's a long story - she shouldn't have signed the note. Either way, after the repossession she received a bill for the remainder of the loan minus the amount it sold for. This bill is to the tune of $16,000. Again, she informed them she would be unable to pay this amount - after which she was offered a settlement of $6,400.

I have offered to finance this settlement amount for my mother, however my sister-in-law is adamantly telling us that her taking the settlement will be a bigger hit on her credit than simply not paying. This sounds very strange to me, is there any truth in this statement?

Thank you for your time,",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ylc7i/mother_cosigned_on_a_vehicle_that_was_repossessed/,1451350246
How does growth in IRA's compound?,"My question is fairly simple. In both my 401k and Roth, I own a number of shares for which the price per share fluctuates depending on the market. Both accounts pay out dividends and both repurchase shares so I understand how that compounds, but is that the only growth that compounds? I'm not worried about down markets since I'm continuously paying in and I have a while before I retire, but I'd like to think that the years that I have positive growth compounds somehow besides reinvesting dividends.

"20k in debt. Working to get out of debt. Questions about consolidation loans, debt-to-income ratio, Lending Club and crowd funding.","Hi Reddit, 

(this is my first time using reddit and my first post ever so if I make any mistakes using reddit, please forgive me!)

My occupation is erotic dancing and my earnings per month fluctuate  - and all my earnings are cash. I'm looking to consolidate 20k in debt and am fortunate enough to have a 1040/1099 I can play with to adjust my earnings to match the lender's specs but I want to know first, how to calculate my debt-to-income ratio and second, how to find out what they need my debt-to-income ratio to be for the optimum APR. I'm looking at the Lending Club because Steve Rhodes (the ""get out of debt guy"") has pull with their lenders when you're on his reading list and can help get me the loan (and also because crowd funding seems like the best option) so I'd love some advice.

(18M CAN) Not sure what I should do with the money I'm saving,"Hello /r/personalfinance

I'm an 18 year old Male, currently taking a year off of school to work. I'm working at a gas station, making 900-1000+ after taxes every month, depending on how many extra hours I pick up. Anyways, I'm definitely a ""saver,"" I save at least half of the money I make each month, even when I make a large purchase ($200+). I've saved about $4000 so far, not including $400 my mom owes me from helping her out with some things. 

So, I know that going to University is going to be expensive. Like most people, I'll probably take a student line of credit in order to afford going to school. I don't have much support from my parents, so I know that, in the end, I'm going to be in mountains of debt. This being said, I wonder if it's really worth it to save as much money as I can and put it into school. I find myself looking at ad listings for cars for hours, fantasizing about having a car. Not an expensive one, something around $3500 that I could pay in cash and all I'd have to worry about is insurance. I also like talking with my girlfriend about traveling during the summer. I know I'm young, and I worry that one day I'll regret not falling in love with my first car, or missing out on traveling when I had the chance. 

So, does anyone have any experience/suggestion as to what I should do with this money? I know that it would be responsible to save my money for school and everything, but is it really worth it? Will I look back when I'm 25 and thank myself for saving me from 10k or so in debt? Or will I be so fucked in the end that it doesn't even matter?

Any help is appreciated

He pays me low pay (1/4 of what is average) for what I do and refuses to pay me extra to cover the increase in taxes I will inevitable have to pay. Now I am not sure what I am suppose to do. I truly know nothing about taxes or self-employment, I go to college and had this has an easy mostly-remote job to work around my school schedule.

"For the first time in my 20+ years of being an adult, I have $0 in credit card debt after Christmas.","I know this may seem a bit crazy to have just now broken that barrier, and in the end we still spent far too much as a whole... But the fact that there is no debt is a massive, massive victory that we have never accomplished before, and we still have a (for our current situation) decent amount left in savings. 

If you'd have told me this would be my future even a year ago, I'd never have believed we would get our heads above water. 

For anyone who doesn't think they can, KEEP TRYING. Never give up. Don't get yourself down. We all slip, like with my past food addiction I never succeeded until I stopped beating myself up about mistakes. 

We had like $70k in debt, and are on a direct track for that to disappear. We even have cards we haven't been able to close with a decent amount of credit, but we did not touch *once* this season. 

Compared to a few years ago where every single card was maxed out continuously, and where available credit was like a sign saying ""free money!"" I could not be happier. 

That's all. I just needed to say this out loud, both as a tooting of my own horn, but also to solidify it for me and remind me if I struggle. 

I don't post here like ever, but this sub has made a difference. If it weren't for Reddit, I may never have gotten a good consolidation loan. So thanks. 

Have an awesome new year. 

**e: Oh holy night, *now* I understand ""RIP my inbox"" comments, but couldn't be happier.**

Thanks to everyone who replied, it means the world! For those with questions I do intend to get back to you, and for those posting words of encouragement, thank you so much for that. 

One question I've gotten a lot is how we did it. That was the part that surprised us. We have a house with minimal equity, which helped a small amount with using that equity to pay down a fraction of our debt, but it was the chunk we needed to get the okay on our consolidation loan (and banks love to have *all* of your accounts). Combined that with our reasonable income (I'm on disability but my wife makes a high 5 figure salary so it gave us a good footing) and the fact that we have not missed a minimum bill payment and it provided us the leverage we desperately needed. 

I can say that one of the best things you can have under your belt is to be able to go to the bank with a positive payment history. Too many late payments really mess with your credit score, so even if you can *only* just make the minimum payment, do that! 

Cutting costs and trying to be more pragmatic is the other huge step that we needed to make. I worked hard to get my health in shape and doing that made my propensity for impulse and worthless spending easier to control. It may sound cliche, but I remember starting to change when Winter Soldier came out, I realized I had about 20k in debt id racked up on a card and had been putting off telling my wife about it every time she asked for a balance. My days were absolutely miserable. I was trying with all my power to avoid telling her, and finally admitting it was *hard as hell*, but we made it through it. 

It is possible to do it, because if someone who has as much of an addiction to buying useless shit as I do can, it's possible for anyone else. Like quitting smoking or losing weight, you very well *may* stumble or even fail. That's natural. Do *not* let that get you down, please don't. We are human and we are all fucked up in our own unique ways, getting out of debt is a very weird and challenging part of life, it may feel like a slog (it sure has for years) and you may get to the ground floor and fail again (this is not our first rodeo with consolidation loans) but if you persist, you may just be able to succeed. 

Again, it's cliche but if you fall, pick yourself up again and get back into the fray. Don't let debt win. It's not worth living your life running to try and play catch-up. That new thing you *must*  have feels that way for a very short time after you buy it, and that feeling goes away.  And when it's gone the only solution is to buy more and more, but being debt free and being able to buy that cool thing without having to go insane figuring out how you'll ever pay it off is **way fucking better.**

"Home renovations and loans, totally perlexed","Hello r/personal finance. 

I'm using a throwaway because I'm going to putting out some personal info that I don't want tied to my account. 

I currently own a 100 year old home and am going through a divorce that will be finalized next month. Basically, I'm buying out my husband from my 401k, which I have around $400k, at the end of January I will be withdrawing $20k as our agreed upon buyout. I currently owe $360k and the house was appraised last month for $600. I currently make $115k a year and invest 10% of my paycheck to my 401k which my company matches. My credit score is is 810 which was pulled in June and my mortgage payment is $2100 per month. I have a credit card, 6.0% apr, which I owe $10k, with $25k limit but will be paid off in a few months. Oh, and i have an emergency fund of around $20k.

So here's where I'm at, I really need to have a bathroom upstairs and I need bigger closets because the house is so old this type of stuff wasn't really needed back then, but me and two small boys, this is very much a necessity. 

I am planning on converting the existing closets a portion of attic space into a bathroom, nothing fancy and then the remaining attic space into two closets. I'm having a contractor come out for s quote but I'm assuming about $250 maybe $30k. Like I said nothing super fancy, but nice, usable and honestly something that will boost my equity. 

After my long winded story, I'm seriously confused about loans. I'm terrified taking out a HELOC and on the fence of fear doing home equity installment loan, mostly because I'm not super comfortable putting my house up as collateral. 

So my question is what kind of loan do I do? Do I get over my fears and do a home equity loan. Do I use a credit card (of course paying off existing debt first), should I do a cash refinance? There are so many different types of loans and everyone has a favorite and to be honest this is really not my area of expertise and just some guidance in layman terms what option is low risk, with a low apr and will help me get my bathroom.

Effect of cash withdrawal from retirement fund on health insurance costs,"My father is about to turn 59, and next year he wants to make a large withdrawal from his retirement fund--possibly as much as $90k. 

The problem is, his income is currently only about $20k per year from a part time job. He gets about $700/mo credit for his healthcare premiums under the ACA, and his daughter is on medicaid.

He is very concerned about what sort of effect withdrawing this money could have on those two things. If his income increased by $90k for next year, he wouldn't get any tax credit for healthcare, and the cheapest plans available are over $600/mo for a crappy high-deductable plan. So that would probably be an extra $8000 or so ""tax"" that he would have to pay for withdrawing the money, on top of all the regular taxes, right?

And then, what would happen to his daughter on medicaid? Would she still be ok for the year, or would they go back and make him pay fees because his income went up?

Is there a possibility that there is some way that he can get his hands on his retirement cash without it adversely affecting these things? He hasn't told me yet what he wants to do with the money, and I haven't pressed him on it. But the thought of having to pay out so much extra has him really stressed, so I am just wondering if there is another angle that we might be overlooking.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wb6m5/effect_of_cash_withdrawal_from_retirement_fund_on/,1449797644

TRID regulations when closing on home,"Hello, I am purchasing a duplex in Wisconsin and I have a conventional loan with 20% down. When the loan was previously approved, the banks underwriter considered stock options which I had available. The closing date is Monday and I guess because of TRID they must go through underwriting again.. I am being credited some money from the security deposits and pro rated rent.. so the full 20% down is not needed for closing. Because of this I saved based on amount I needed to close and decided NOT to liquidate any stock to pull the full 20% down.. but the bank is stating because of TRID they cannot take into account credits we are getting (specifically security deposits), they are saying we must liquidate stock to bring total available to the 20% down total. I find this incredibly stupid because any stocks I exercise will not even be used on day of closing.

Given interest rates I'm inclined to agree that it might not be a good time to buy bonds, but my thinking was ""if interest rates suck, bonds will be cheap.""   Do they work like that in terms of how they track the market?

My investment strategy,"Hello reddit, I'm here today to see what you guys think of my financial strategy. 

To start off my idea consists of buying a house every year for the next several years to gain equity. I joined the military this year and am going to school for a few years and would have no need to use these properties for personal use, I plan on renting them out to people and using va loans to get the property loans in the first place. My parents own a property management company and have been doing it in the area for 40 years. I plan on buying next summer, with a budget of under 200k and a 15 or 20 year mortage. I have about 5k saved up and currently plan to not put anything down on the house and using anything I make currently as an emergency fund for the house. Now I have a few questions I'm looking for insight on. 

1. To get a va loan I need to have 3 examples that I can pay off debt, currently I am buying my mom's car off of her and refinancing it, I have 2 credit cards, however I still need 1-2 more ways to show I have the ability to pay the loans off. 

2. What's a solid amount of emergency money to have for the property? 

3. What kind of interest rates will I be looking at? 
4. Are there any seriously bad ideas for doing this?

Should I dip into rainy day fund or take student loans?,"My wife and I are in a spot where we need some extra cash to live and to pay my tuition this coming semester. I have a decent rainy day fund which is stock bought using my company's stock purchase program, but I am hesitant to touch it because it is also kind of a retirement fund and the stock is doing really well. I can take student loans to cover living expenses and tuition, but that is obviously a loan that comes with interest attached. I am an engineering student, so I feel like I will be able to get a good job coming out of school with sufficient income to pay back the loan.

Advice is appreciated. Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wl9op/should_i_dip_into_rainy_day_fund_or_take_student/,1449970127
Credit hard pull still present after 2 years,"It's been a couple weeks since the 2 year anniversary of a hard pull on a credit report.

From my understanding of the credit/credit reports section of the FAQ, the hard pull should no longer be on my credit reports.

However, having recently pulled a report (after the 2 year window), it still appears on my report.

With what precision does the 2 year period apply?

Do they get cleared out on a (calendar) monthly basis?

This is indeed a hard pull from opening a credit card over 2 years ago and not a promotional inquiry or a periodic account review.

"Bank of America stole almost a $1,000 from me on Christmas Eve. Any advice?","Backstory:

I have a Bank of America credit card that has a high credit limit, low interest (9.9) and I've  had it for almost 15 years. It was originally a Visa through my credit union, but in 2008 when the banks collapsed, Bank of America bought it out and now my card belongs to BOA. 

Fast forward to 2010, I open a photography studio and use this card to facilitate various purchases for my business. It winds up with a high balance around $10,000 after various ventures fail to work out. 

Fast forward to October 2015, my business turns around and I pay off the card in October. I began paying $985.09  a month in the previous 12 months to pay off the remaining balance within the span of a year. Come October 24th, 2015, I make my final payment taking the card to a zero balance. 

On December 24th, 2015 I awoke to find a notification from BOA that my payment of $985.09 has been received. I immediately check my checking account and sure enough, it has been deducted. I double-check my BOA statements and show no activity at all this year other  than my payments and the zero balance. 

I immediately contact BOA and speak with ""Kathleen"" who advised that they deducted $985.09 incorrectly due to ""technical difficulties."" She advised they would refund the full amount in 2-5 business days. Obviously, they pulled this shit on Christmas Eve, so I have had limited funds to travel with. Today is Sunday December 27 and still no sign of the money returned to my account. 

Other than the refund and a heartfelt apology, do I have any recourse at all to recoup the money due to the shitty timing of all of this? I shifted money around so I avoided any overdraft fees, etc. But, this has been a huuuge pain in the ass to deal with on Christmas.

Also, it may be helpful to add that this is not the first time this year they had ""technical difficulties"" with my account. Twice they incorrectly calculated my interest charges and overcharged me. Total, the incorrect charges were just under $400. I watch my accounts like a hawk and I just happened to notice the errors while reviewing my statements. BOA did immediately refund the charges without any problems. I wonder how many thousands didn't catch their errors in Bank Of America's favor.

Any advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yer0a/bank_of_america_stole_almost_a_1000_from_me_on/,1451233515
"Wage Statement says I'm claiming 99 Federal Allowances and 3 State Allowances, help.","Hello, I'm posting today because I just recently checked my wage statement from my job delivering pizzas to find that I have 99 federal allowances claimed and 3 state allowances.

[Tax Software] Why I want to never again use H&amp;R Block. HELP!,"I found myself nearing the filing deadline early this year and went out to buy some software - well HRBlock was half the cost and imports TurboTax files: sounds good!

Using the software went smoothly.  They had the same gouging principles and charge for every state you file in, as well as every one you download after the first.

When finishing the filing they even had the option of taking some or all of the refund money as credits you turn into store credits at one of a few dozen stores, and if you do, you get an extra 10% credit!  I decided to try it and put 1/3 of my refund towards it.

A couple weeks after I'd finished filing, I was surprised that my local state mailed me because HRBlock didn't send either a form or a copy of the other returns - maybe both.  I printed them out and took care of it.  But: Strike 1.

The regular refunds were deposited as expected in my bank account.

Then I got the email from HRBlock and created an account on hrblock.com so I could access the other 1/3 +10%.  That part went smoothly, except most browsers wouldn't work with their website.  And they disable letting you paste a secure password into the login.  Strikes 2 and 3.

I went to take out my money and things got dicey:  You don't get a gift certificate.  You can't take out your money.  You either use your PC to get an electronic credit that you can only spend on the stores websites, or you have to use your ""web-enabled mobile device"" to try doing something they never explain until after you redeem the funds to get a credit that way.  Strike 4.

I made the hrblock.com account, allocated part of the credit to one store, got the HRBlock email, went through the very painful process of spending it on target.com, etc. etc.  Including damaged product returns this took over 4 hours and ruined my week.  Strike 5 (and Target/.com gets a couple dozen strikes of their own!)

Today I go back to hrblock.com to redeem the rest of my refund - and they won't let me in.  I tried logging in a few times on a couple browsers.  I even tried their ""forgot password"" but they say they cannot find my account.  Strikes 6 and 7.

Well, the email were I was notified of setting up my account had their support number, so I called it.

They have no clue what I'm talking about!!!

The first person, Jessica, was helpful and tried passing me along to their software product support.  Why?  Because they don't know how to handle this.  But the number never rang: the automated voice said ""Please hang up and redial the toll-free number"".  Huh?  Strikes 8 and 9.

So I tried again.  HRBlock's automated voice system is slow, stupid, ponderous, and asks innane questions every time you call.  Strike 10.

The second woman on the phone simply could not understand what I wanted, nor what my problem was.  She kept trying to ask me questions obviously on her script but my answer was always 'No' - none of those.  When I asked for her supervisor, she left briefly but when she came back had obviously never talked with anyone and asked more stupid questions.  So I kept asking to talk with a supervisor and at minute 14 the phone seemed to timeout - no one had answered from HRBlock for a couple minutes.  Strikes 11, 12, and 13.

The third person I got to in customer service, I tried asking immediately for a supervisor, but she wanted to understand, so I went for it - and *then* she looked for a supervisor, but there was none to be found.  She said I could call back tomorrow, Saturday, between 4AM and 11PM MT - sooooooo the supervisor left early on a Friday but won't on a Saturday??  She also said there was a way to chat with their people online, but could not tell me where to go nor how to do it.  When I asked for a URL they simply disappeared from the line.  Strikes 14 and 15.

So here I am, trying to get my money from HRBlock.com where they refuse to acknowledge me and whose customer service can't even comprehend the situation.

Excellent credit = Denied Mortgage Application. Warning: Rant Inside,"I'm on a throwaway here.  Three years ago I started a project here in Florida, I live in Miami.  One of the ongoing projects I was helping manage went out to bid every two years, after the two year period was completed, we lost the contract to a competitor.  Later that day, the competitor calls me up and offers me a $150K raise, I was previously making about $120K.  So, naturally I took it.  The firm was new and they asked me if I would start as a 1099 as it would be easier for them to get their finances in order, no problem.  Huge raise, I took it.  As promised a year later, the new company brings me on as a W2 with a small pay cut, due to payroll taxes, SS matches, etc.. No problem, understood.  Now, I bought a small 2/2 condo in cash in 2011.  Since then the price of the condo has doubled, and I decided to go out for a mortgage. After all I have an +800 credit score, few debts, my company is very generous with my expense account, company car, etc..  Living good.  Now, the mortgage specialist tells me that I have been DENIED a small mortgage because basically the 1099 (one year) employment has basically erased my entire work history! WTF! I can contact them next year she said, you know after the fed raises rates.  Thanks a lot.  I've worked in the fucking capacity for ten fucking years, no judgements, no liens, no x-wives, and one year of 1099 has erased my entire employment history?

If the underwriters are denying an Applicant like me, who exactly is getting a mortgage these days?

Relevant info:

- Early 30s, partnered, partner has just bought a house (nothing in my name), we'd like to get one with acreage one day.
- I may never be able to work again so this money would help set my future up.
- No kids, may not be able to have kids, may adopt / foster.
- I have a poor history with money, I have been bankrupt and I can lack self control.
- Currently only have a (maxed) $4k credit card.

"Finally some substantial savings/income, looking for advice","Hi all - I'd love to get some advice/thoughts on my specific situation.

I'm 32 y/o, currently making $130k/year.  I have a savings account of approximately $90k, and two 401(k)'s from former employers with about $53k combined.  I currently rent my apartment, but plan on buying a home likely within the next 3 years.

I've maxed out in 2015 for 401(k) contributions, and intend on doing the same in 2016 when I begin my new employer's 401(k) which has no match.  They've put me in touch with an advisor from Mass Mutual who has suggested that I rollover both old accounts into an IRA.

In addition to a retirement account, I put around $1,000-$1,500 towards my savings account each month.

I'm pretty conservative when it comes to investing (which is probably fairly obvious given that I only have a savings account), but would love to get my money to work for me.  Here are my questions:

1) Should I go the IRA route or just rollover into the new 401(k)?  Why?

2) If I do go the IRA route, should I take advantage of the additional $5,500 contribution I'm allowed?

3) What should I do with my savings account right now?  As far as I can tell CD's, money markets, etc. pay hardly anything anymore.

4) Is a $90,000 down payment on a home within 3 years a reasonable expectation (20% down in NYC metro area)?

5) Anything else?

Leasing a car - yes or heck no?,"Hello! Longtime lurker finally posting :-) I need to decide if I should go through with leasing a car or sticking it out with my '07 Camry that's hitting high digits on the odometer. I realize that it's basically renting a car and isn't financially advisable for the future, but I'm feel a bit between a rock and a hard place right now. I would ask my family, but I know they would immediately tell me not to do it. I came here because I know you are rational people and I need to hear from both sides.


I make a bit more than 30k in an expensive state and own my car though there is 6k left to pay off. The odometer is reaching 140,000 and is starting to have issues so I've been seriously considering leasing after trading in my car. I'd have enough to pay off the remaining debt and a few extra thousand. My current car payment is $300 with a terrible interest rate and my credit is in the 600's. 


My first question is would I have to pay more with just an ok credit score when I lease? Should I just refinance my car? 


Since my ex husband is still technically my co-signer for the car loan through my bank, what effect would that have on me selling the car or refinancing? He does not pay anything on the car and is not entitled to it at all per our divorce agreement.

Income:
80 and 8K yearly bonus in January
Assets:
10K cash
9K Roth IRA
15K current 401K
10K previous 401K 
2K personal trading account (just Disney stock)

Debt:
20K (not incurred yet) for an MBA.
Will incur over next four years.
This is after employer sponsored education reimbursements.

Expenses:
800 a month for rent including all the other bills, rounding up.

Debating between 3 credit cards vs. 2,"Hi guys, I am trying to figure out whether I should carry three credit cards or two. I currently have the Discover It card and the Bank of America Cash cash rewards card. I like the Bank of America card because it gets me 3% back on gas (2% back on groceries, but I don't grocery shop), but I use it universally for everything. That only nets me 1% cash back on most of my purchases. I recently applied and got the Citi 2% cash back on all purchases card. I'm not sure I like the idea of having three credit cards, not because I don't trust myself, but because it might be too many to keep track of (fraudulent purchases, remembering to pay bills etc.).  
  
I've reviewed my past few months of spending habits and concluded that less than 50% of my balance is spent on gas. This would net me more cash back if I was using the plain 2% cash back on everything, since the BoA card only gives me 1% back on all other purchases. i calculated it to be around 17% more cash back if I used the 2% card.  
  
Now here is the dilemma. Should I close the Bank of America card and lose out on 1% more cashback on gas, but with one less card to worry about, or keep it open and only use it for gas. I also forgot to mention that the Discover card has 5% cashback on gas for a quarter of the year, so that is a quarter of the year I won't even touch the BoA card. I like the idea of the simplicity of having only 2 cards, but technically I would maximize my cash back by having all three cards. This would however, split my cash rewards up across three different accounts making it harder to get a significant amount of rewards in any certain account.  
  
What's your opinion?

401k Loan Payments: Is T. Rowe Price making an error?,"I took out a $5,000 loan against my 401k account at 4% interest in July 2015 and made regular weekly payments with payroll until October-end 2015 when I left my job to pursue another employment opportunity.

My old employer's plan allows for a 75-day grace period after departure in order to pay back the loan so that it is not deemed distributed and I incur the 10% penalty and income taxes. This period ends on January 7th, 2016 (i.e. 2 weeks).

Between signing bonus, higher pay and regular weekly payments, to date, I have made $4,250 in payments: this per MY records AND T. Rowe prices. However, my current loan balance says $1,210 dollars right now and I don't understand why. Making an overestimate for interest at $100 (4% on 5k for 1/2 the year), I would expect a balance of maybe 850-900 at the most. There were no origination fees, and my loan to overall ratio didn't come close to hitting that 50% maximum threshold. 

So is there another common penalty or change that I'm missing that's typically assessed to these larger institutional 401k plans? Or should I give them a call?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3y7592/401k_loan_payments_is_t_rowe_price_making_an_error/,1451065198
How do I stop myself from spending money? First month with debit card- wasted 500 dollars.,"Hello
I'm 17 years old. I've recently gotten myself a debit card. I sold a bunch of stuff and deposited up to about 2000$.

I'm down 500 dollars, and feel terrible for wasting it. I feel a strong urge to bet and try to make it back. I dont know how I can save up by myself.

Issues paying off debt collection agency,"Over the course of my life I have made very stupid decisions regarding personal finance. I won't bore you with the details but about a year ago I decided that I had had enough of poor credit and bad spending habits and began working on turning my financial life around. I started this off by contacting the debt collectors that hold my debt directly based on the contact information I found for them in my credit report. 
I have been able to start doing significant repairs to my credit through this but I have run into a roadblock with the current creditor that I have been repaying. I have been paying off this particular creditor for a little over five months with two payments to them each month but they have not reflected the repayment status of this debt on my credit report which still shows it as delinquent with no attempt at repayment and also derogatory comments to the same effect. I have contacted them several times and asked why they have not reported my repayment and they assure me that they have but it is just not being reflected on my credit report yet. 
At this points five months into repayment I don't believe that they have reported a single payment and I would like to know what my recourse is, if any against them. This is the largest account reflecting negatively on my credit report and I am more than a little irritated at this point.

College Subsidized Loan,"Hi there,

So I have a question about college subsidized loan, specifically Stafford. I pulled out a $5500 loan at 4.25% to pay for summer classes when I was in college. I'm about 3 years removed from college and have been doing an auto pay of $56 per month. I have about $4000 left to pay off.

What I was wondering is, should I pay this off sooner rather than later? I noticed that in the first few years the loan was front loaded to pay off the interest first, does it make sense to pay it off in full and just be done with it or are the government subsidize rates so good that it just makes sense to pay $56 per month until the loan is paid off?

Need to talk myself out of buying a $60k car.,"A couple of years ago during a particular snowy winter and many snow struggles with my current FWD car I decided to start saving for a new car - one with AWD.  This June I started a new job that pays me 70k per year and this fall I started seriously looking for my next car; my current car is 11 years old and has 107k miles on it and I really don't feel like putting more money into it (just had a $700 maintenance repair).  

I have two absolutes for my next car: True AWD and CPO.  One of the cars I'm considering is a 2013 CPO Audi S7; there's one on Autotrader for $60k with 21k miles on it.  The looks, the specs; I almost salivate imagining myself driving this car.  Of all the cars I'm considering, I would enjoy driving this one the most.  

I've run the numbers for this car and as far as I can determine I can afford this car.  I've been saving $1000 per month for the past few years and will be able to put $30k down on the car, leaving 30k to finance.  I've gotten approved for a loan for this car and if I save the remaining of the payment I'll be able to pay the car off in 31 months, which includes the increased insurance premium that will eat into my monthly budget.  According to the conventional wisdom of 28%/36% debt levels, I'll still be comfortably under, but I would be exceeding the 10% rule of the 20/4/10 rule.   

The more I think about this car the weaker my resolve gets.  But as it stands, even if I don't get this car now, I'm just going to keep putting $1000 away each month and will probably end up buying this car anyway, just with less financed.  Either that or Minnesota will get a winter storm and I'll have one white-knuckle drive to or from work too many and will get so fed up I'll make an emotional purchase just to get myself out of my current car.

I've been hemming and hawing for two months and feel I need to figure out a course of action.

Help With Scummy Landlord Collections,"Hello PF, 

**EDIT: tl;dr: Landlord sent me to collections 60 days after I moved out without ever sending a bill. What can I do? (Sorry for the wall of text!)**

Greeting from Colorado!

Longtime reader, though haven't had a reason to ask for help directly until now. I'm in need of some advice as to how I should proceed.

In August, I moved out of my apartment. I had a good relationship with the management company, always payed my rent on time, never had a complaint, etc. I had a dog in the apartment that the landlord was aware of, and I paid a pet deposit and pet rent as stipulated in my lease. **Other than this, I was never charged for a security deposit of any kind.**

My dog was a puppy when I first got her, and she did some damage to the carpet that would require replacement. Prior to moving out, I notified my landlord and was told verbally that it would cost roughly $400 to replace the carpet. I said that sounded reasonable, and they said they would send me a bill. On the day before my move out, I scheduled an appointment with the super to do a walk through so I could settle up any other charges as needed. Walkthrough was fine, we talked about the carpet briefly and he echoed what the leasing office had told me. As he was walking out, he noticed that a few of the laminate floor tiles by the front door were beginning to peel up (5-6 tiles max). I had noticed this previously but since the flooring material appeared cheap I assumed it would be normal wear and tear. Boy was I wrong. 

He told me that ordinarily, the damaged tiles could be replaced. However, since they had had issues with other units in the building, they were out of the material used for my floor. As a result, the super told me that I would be responsible for replacing the *entire* floor, which he unofficially quoted as roughly **$3,000.** I said that this was normal wear and tear on poor quality flooring, but he insisted that it was the dog. (It wasn't, but what can I do?) I told the super that this sounded excessive, and we agreed that I would speak with the leasing office regarding the costs. 

I called the leasing office, and they insisted that charging to replace the entire floor was fair. I asked them how much it would cost, and they said that they were waiting on their contractor to find out. I tried to politely argue the charge/negotiate, but they said that we should wait for the bill before continuing. I confirmed all of my contact info with them (phone, email, new address, parent (cosigner) info) and left. After that, I never received a bill. No bill for the floor, no bill for the carpet, nothing. I decided not to call and follow up as I didn't want to rock the boat in the event they had forgotten about the issue (they're incredibly disorganized). I was also under the [impression](http://www.tenant.net/Other_Areas/Colorado/crs/103.html) that after 30 days (I believe my lease specified 60, though I'm unclear as that clause referred to a security deposit which I wasn't required to pay) they couldn't charge me for anything. 

Flash forward to today, when I get home and notice a letter in the mail from a collections agency. They are demanding upwards of $3,000 in un-payed damages from my landlord. I never received a bill from them, or an itemized list of charges as I believe is stipulated by law. The letter is dated 59 days after the end of my lease (November 11), and I'm not sure when it arrived as I was out of town for a week and a half. I'm tempted to request validation of the debt, and I believe I'll need to send a letter ASAP via certified mail to do this. However, I'm not sure if I should wait and speak with a lawyer first, or just pay them before it is reported to my credit report and save myself 7.5 years of damaged credit. 

I'm a 21 year old college student and haven't had to deal with anything like this before. Please help!

Thank you

"23, £600k and unsure how to begin investing and who to trust with my money","I'm 23 and from the UK, I play online poker professionally which is tax free in the UK. The only investment I have done so far is buying a student property with friends and £30k in government premium bonds. I estimate I will only be able to continue with poker for 2-3 more years so I need this money invested so that it can provide me an income. I expect to have &gt;£1M to invest by the time I finish poker.

I have no idea about investing so recently I had a consultation with a friends dad who runs a company called margetts wealth management who gave me some advice and obviously want to take me on as a customer. 

They gave me a lot of information about how they would invest and manage my money, with the bulk being in an offshore bond with prudential (a low risk investment group they told me) then other money in a slightly higher risk personal portfolio and ISAs and a £240/mo pension scheme.

I was told all of my money would be in a wrap, and I could follow everything easily. They would take 2% of the initial money I gave them and then 1% a year.

I don't know if this is the best way to invest my money, or if property or something else would be better. I don't have a lot of spare time to spend working on my investments so I think someone managing it for me would be best.

I am sceptical about how things were presented to me, in a kind of too good to be true way.

To be approved for this, you need to email or call the representative listed with a few requirements and also list the parts you wish to purchase.  

After sending all of this I received an email this afternoon statin all of the (newly) priced items at about 10-15% discount (awesome!). The email also includes the following text, which I found incredibly off.

&gt; If you'd like to complete an order, feel free to call or email me with your credit card number, expiration date, and 3 digit code OR send a paypal payment to sales@perrinperformance.com, just put it to my attention.  

I shot the representative an email back asking if he could somehow give me a discount code equalling the amount of the discount I was to receive noted in his email, as it didn't feel right to do either of the options listed. I am also going to call tomorrow to see if he could answer some other questions I may have. 

I can't wrap my head around it being a scam, as it is from a reputable company, it just seems odd that the initial payment options listed were what he mentioned.   

Any help or suggestions would be great, or maybe someone has used their discounts before? For all I know this is completely normal, but I've never been asked to send my ""credit card number, expiration, and 3 digit code"" to someone via email.

I'm about to take a trip inside the US with my whole family totaling over 5K in expenses, originally was planning on charging it to my Chase credit card for 1% cash back but recently came across the Citi bank which offfers 50,000 miles with AA if you spend $3,000 in the first 3 months and waives the $96 fee for first year.

I'm obviously interested in that deal since I travel with AA frequently and that's enough for a round trip to Europe during non-peak season. My question is however, is it smart to do?

My info:

* Credit card #1 with local bank: $4,000 limit - 2000-Present

*this credit card is used only for my netflix/hulu subscription and nothing else (used to be my main card in college)*

* Credit card #2 with Chase: $10,000 limit - 2013 to present

*this is my everyday card, I purchase everything using this card and pay it off in full each month*

* Credit score: 752

"1-bedroom apartment sharing utilities with 3-bedroom home, feels like utilities are now unfair for frugal me this winter","cross-post from /r/relationships, but I was hoping to hear something from the finance side to see if it's worth the hassle. *If this is not appropriate here I'll promptly delete it*.

I moved onto this property about a year ago. I live in a mother-in-law and I share the utilities with the main house, 70-30 split.

With the first neighbors in lived in the main house, my bill came in at $30-35. When they left, I had about a month to myself at $27.

My new neighbors came in and the it was closer to $35-40 a month. A bit more, but hey, we're neighbors.

The summer came and they installed an A/C unit. I do not have an A/C unit, nor does anyone else on my block. Because it gets at most 80 degrees and maybe five 90 degree days. You open a window and it's all good.

I mentioned my concerns to my landlord and she said there was nothing to do about it. Summer bill. $45-50. At this point, I really feel like I'm paying for them and I bring it up to my landlord, who says they'll talk to them. Nothing changes and now I don't know what to do.

The summer ends and the bill drops to about $40, so I just eat the difference. But the first ""winter"" bill comes in and it's at $70.

I'm using my wall heater, but it comes on at most twice a day. On top of that, most of the bill came from electricity, which...I don't know how can be so high. For 4 people, the total was $230. I've never paid more than $40 my life in utilities and now it's nearly double that.

My questions are basically if this normal? Should I address the neighbors directly at this point? Should I just suck it up? Is it not a big deal? I'm just frustrated at this point because I'm barely in my house and I feel like this is just throwing away money.

TL;DR: My shared utilities bill jumped from $40 to $70 in one month despite minimal usage on my part. Is this normal or should I talk with my neighbors?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3y3ji4/1bedroom_apartment_sharing_utilities_with/,1450977468

"Graduating med school soon, just received control of a 30k investment account","I am 26 y/o and will be graduating from medical school June 2017 without debt (thanks Mom and Dad). I was just made aware of an account in my name that has about 30k in it from contributions made by my grandparents when I was young (held in stock).


I am looking for advice on where to keep this money, and if it'd be advantageous to take action now while I am in a low tax bracket. I currently make $0. I will make ~$50,000/year for 3 years in residency. And then I will likely be making $200,000+ from there on out. 


The options I see are:

A) Leave it and let it ride

B) Sell now. Pay the lowest capital gains. Start reinvesting the money into a Roth IRA while I am still eligible.


I'm sure there are other options too. Please let me know what action would best suit me. Thanks in advance!

That said, I'm wondering if contributing more than $1,000/year to my 401k makes sense? I don't expect to have any huge expenses (house, car) in the next 5 years, but I may want to have more control in my investments as well as the flexibility of liquidating it whenever I want opposed to waiting until retirement with a 401k. My other confusion comes from the difference between  investing in index funds via a 401k or some arbitrary brokerage account. The only differences I see is that I can't sell off my assets with a 401k until retirement but my investments outside of this 401k will always be post-tax.

Was switching to Progressive literally today because I finally had the money. Never been in an accident my whole life. Have always had insurance. When it rains it fucking pours, I guess. 

I have a loan for this car, about $10,000 left with Wells Fargo. I got the car from a dealership (Shannon Motors in Rhode Island). I don't know if any sort of gap period applies with this situation because I'm switching to a new insurance company.

There was also a point in time about 2 years ago when I had to go about a month without insurance (just never drove my car) and was told that Wells Fargo was going to apply their own insurance? I'm not sure if this was warning me that they would be doing this, or if their own insurance was covering me for that small amount of time and just adding it to my weekly payments.

I'm about to ready to curl up in a ball and die because I can't believe this has actually happened to me. I'm freaking out.

I can't seem to decide between an older (2003-2010) car or a relatively newer car (2010+)

Some more info.

* **Income:** ~$28k / year working part time, but will likely Uber / Lyft on weekend nights to supplement my income
* **Savings:** ~$8k in a savings account
* **Expenses:** ~$1.5k / month tends to cover everything currently, but after I get a car, there'll be gas, parking, insurance, maintenance, emergencies, etc.
* **Car Budget:** Anywhere between $6k - $12k? Don't really know, but I feel like $12k is pushing it as that's $350 per month for 3 years which I would get tired of after the 1st year and a half of payments lol.
* **Credit:** FICO is 803 last I checked. Parents are also willing to loan me cash upfront to buy the car so I have the option of paying them back at 0% which can make things cheaper in the long run.

Am basically looking for:

* Something that'll just work without too much trouble as I'm not super handy / car savvy. Am willing to do research and learn how fix basic issues myself, but not really a car enthusiast so I won't be a tinkerer. People seem to recommend Toyotas / Hondas and newer Hyundais (don't know after what year..)
* Something without too many miles as I know fewer miles is better. Is there a approximate limit I should be looking for? Under 50k? Under 100k?
* Something that won't break the bank! Maybe my budget of $6k - $12k is way off. I just kinda assumed that I'd have to spend that much to get a 'decent' car that runs reliably without too much car knowledge. 

In terms of options, here are some models I've been looking at

* [57k miles - 2007 Toyota Corolla LE - $6,700](http://buggybank.org/car.php?jj&amp;vehicle=21892)
* [72k miles - 2008 Honda Civic - $8,450](https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/cto/5339579881.html)

Also, I have nothing in 401K/IRAs or other investments since I wasn't sure if I'd be moving back to India and didn't want to pay absurd penalties and taxes for taking it out prematurely/transferring it to an overseas account.

Background-

1) I'm not a US citizen (Indian origin) and moved to the US in 2009 for college. 

2) After college, I worked for a consulting firm for 2 years in the US. After that, my visa expired and I couldn't secure a new US work visa due to the high demand (Thanks US immigration system! :/)

3) My company has now sent me to work in the UK for a year so they can try and get a new visa application for next year

4) Between all this, I have been thinking about going back to the US for an MBA, after which I may decide to work there or move back to India for good.
 

Now, I'm looking for some advice around the following-

* How to choose a 401k/IRA type account that will allow me to financially plan for the future without having to worry about moving countries? (US to India in this case..)
* How to make other investments with my current savings (Mutual funds/ETFs etc.) while minimizing my tax liabilities from earnings in other countries?

Current PhD student. How to tackle emergency fund/student loans/retirement on a small stipend?,"First time posting; I read through the FAQ but am looking for some more specific suggestions on how to balance my emergency fund, student loans, and/or retirement funds.

I am a 30 year old PhD student with ~2-3 more years until I finish. My stipend covers all living expenses, and combined with a frugal lifestyle I'm able to save ~$1k a year. I'm in a STEM field where starting salaries typically exceed $80k, so I'm not concerned about money down the road, but I want to make sure I'm setting myself up for a good financial future *now*.  I currently have ~$30k in student loan debt from my undergraduate degree:

- $14k at 6.8% (yikes)

- $4.5k at 4.5%

- $9k at 3.4%

- $2k at 1.5%

I have no credit card/house/auto debt. I have $10,000 set aside in savings accounts, but $5-6k would likely be a sufficient emergency fund for 6 months.

Is this a bad idea or can I afford it?,"Some Background info:
I'm 20 years old in college and work full time. I make typically 1700-2000$ a month after taxes. I currently pay 450$ for rent, and then my credit card bills which aren't much. Couple hundred here and there. I'm currently Leasing a 2014 Challenger that I pay 330 a month for and then 100 for insurance. Long story short:
My lease is almost up and I want another Challenger but I'm thinking of financing a used one that's around 27k. Can I afford this? I don't have much bills, I would probably do a 72 month loan or a 60 month loan. Insurance stays the same price.

"25(m) changed job and passed from $10,000 in 2014 to $100,000 in 2015. Need advice!","I posted this as my first Reddit post ever in Moronic Monday but they suggested me to make a separate thread so here we go:  

25(m), living in Poland – not Polish though – and 2015 has changed my life. At the end of 2014 I left my $10,000 a year job and got hired in a hardcore sales one. I’ve done really well this year earning around $130k (gross) thanks mostly to my commissions as my base salary is only $12,000. After taxes, social security, accountant, etc I was left with about $100,000 net to me (employer had me opening my own company and invoicing him, but that's fine).  

To put it in perspective, the average yearly salary in Poland for 2015 was a bit less than $10,000. So I made like 10x the average, which is really awesome. But I’m really not used to having money, I’ve always lived paycheck to paycheck and it’s really stressing me to have money and I feel I’m on a very important moment in my life and I should learn how to take care of this money, save, invest and secure my financial future.  

On the last two weeks I’ve been reading non-stop this subreddit, watching the recommended videos on investing, and I’m purchasing a couple of books from the list as well to read during the holidays. But I have some questions that are bothering me and I’d love some advice from you:  

1. My income is really unstable. In January, February, April, June &amp; July I got 0 commissions, so I only earned $1000. But then in November for example, I got $50,000. So: how can I make a good budget and predict well 2016?  

2. I’ve made an emergency fund of $20k into 3 accounts - $10k for rent, utilities, groceries, etc in a common account with my SO. $5k in my companies account to cover social security, accountant, phone bill, and the 19% tax on my base salary ($2k). And $5k for my personal expenses, transport, some flights, etc. So those $20k cover all the expenses I can predict for 2016. Do you think is a good setup?  

3. I bought $8,5k in virtual currencies, as I really believe in them. I got 22 BTC and 95 LTC, and right now they are worth about $10k, although I consider this a long-term investment.  

4. My bank offers me a very good interest rate on the savings account of 2,4% yearly, paid monthly. I’ve put around $12,5k there. If I reach over $25k they’ll increase the % to 2,6. Is this a good enough rate to put all my money there? I’m reading in many places/advices that you should aim returns of 10% yearly on your investments.. so 2,6% feels like it’s not good enough?  

5. There are no 401(k) here and I can’t open an IRA retirement account because I don’t know if I’ll retire here.. probably not. Can I open this type of accounts in my home country even though I’m not a fiscal resident there?  

6. I want to invest in stocks or funds, and my bank offers an online broker that looks very good. But I can only invest in Polish stock market and Polish funds. The political situation is bad right now and the market is not doing great, so probably not a good idea. Also the funds I’m seeing are all with high management fees.. anyone in Europe can recommend me something similar to this Vanguard everyone talks about? I can’t seem to find index funds with low fees and stable returns here. I’d like to invest my last $20k saved in those options to try and get higher returns.  

2016 seems will be good though, as with the sales I’ve done already I’m guaranteed around $50k, although $15k of those are in November so a long time still to earn those.. Appreciate any feedback, comments, advice, etc. It’s a totally new situation for me and I want to use it good! Thank you in advance.

25-yr-old with stable job interested in entering the Financial Sector part time as a Financial Advisor in young firm/brokerage. Looking for (Career?) advice.,"First off, I am in Canada, and I know very little about finance and the financial sector.

I'm a 25 yr old working a stable job earning roughly $30/hr that's only going to increase every year. I'm happy where I am but not content? 

I have a friend that works as a financial advisor in a relatively young (6-7 years old) financial brokerage/firm. What's special about their firm is that most of their financial advisors do not have a financial or business background, but with the help of the firm (through training and guidance) they've all gotten their LLQP (Life License Qualification Program) license (It's the licensing exam in Canada, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLQP). They seem to be doing very well and there is even a guy there that's only been licensed for 2 years and working full time making close to 6 digit. They're completely commission-based.  

Okay so they've approached me and are interested in recruiting me and getting me through the LLQP at the same time. They don't mind/like the fact that I have a job already and can only do it part time. They say that the reward could be ludicrous selling insurance and helping others save through RRSP, RESP, TFSA, and using investment leverage with segregated funds. I know little about that last one. 

They also have this initiative that basically let me bring in potential clients, set up a meeting, and they would do a 1 on 1 with the client with me in the room. If the deals went through I would get 50% of the compensation (even though I'm not licensed yet, they set up an account for me and put that money in there and I can access it after I get licensed). That way they say I could learn from firsthand experience and it would help me greatly with my licensing exam. 

So I guess my question is, is this worth the plunge to do part time as a financial advisor? Is it as good as it sounds (I know commission-based jobs aren't going to be easy at first, and that hard work needs to be put in to get rewards)? 

The time spent vs. earnings seem to be pretty good and I think I could pull it off part time and I am not bad at being a salesman and planning things. The financial sector is foreign to me but I wouldn't mind getting out of my comfort zone and trying it out if through hardwork I can be compensated enough as a side job.

I need a loan to take Computer Coding classes- but bad credit,"I have bad credit cause I'm poor... I was using credit to keep afloat after college graduation (Liberal Studies degree... no $) and planned I would get a job and pay it back but I never did. Could not get even a halfway decent job. I had amazing grades and experience but  a real lack of specific direction. I got into grad school but didn't take it.

So now I am taking computer classes online at Udacity, which is a great website. When complete, and I do have talent in CS, I'll be making 60k minimum. I'm soooo broke right now. I plan to buy a camper, which is like being a part of the tiny house movement, so I can live extremely cheap until I finish my classes and get a high paying job. Maybe 6-9 months from now. 

So I'm planning for $3,000 in loans. That should cover living, the cost for the classes ($200 a month after I complete the intro class), and buying a cheap camper for around $500. I get free food and medical and the rent for a camper will be free or cheap per month, so I don't need much money. I can do some work for whatever extra I need.

Where should I apply for loans? I don't care how much I'll pay when I get my job. I just need money to get there. I'm so determined because I've been living the last 2 years poor as f*** and I'm ready to make a big change.

Family has always been in severe debt. Because of this I ended up not getting a cheaper car or license when I was younger. No one had the money for it including myself.

I currently have no money. No car and have never had a drivers license. If I were suddenly able to have a car tomorrow I still couldn't afford to fuel and insure it (insurance would be huge considering I have no driving history) 

Because of not having a vehicle. I can't get a job anywhere. I live outside of the city limit and they don't run a bus here. Taxi is out of the question. No employment ventures nearby that I could potentially bike to or walk to. 

My work history. I virtually have none. Credit history is nothing. I've never had a credit card or paid any bills.

Currently living with family. On SNAP food stamps ($200 food credit monthly) . I'm also uninsured so in case anything happens to me I'll have to visit the ER and get emergency care.

I would prefer to have a vehicle and a job. I don't like living off food stamps and being uninsured and poor. But I don't see how I can get out of the current situation I'm in.  No employer in their right mind would give me a chance. Zero work history and no transportation to work? No education either.

Pennsylvanians with a Traditional 401k: Your contributions are taxed by the state. Your distributions upon retirement age are not.,"All,

Just wanted to let all residents of Pennsylvania be aware of a weird state tax law. Unlike the federal government and most other states (possibly all), Pennsylvania treats 401k, 403b, and SIMPLE plans differently. Contributions to your traditional 401k are taxed in the year you make the contribution, but will not be taxed when you begin to take distributions at age of retirement. This means that at the state-level, your traditional 401k works like a Roth. [Here's the PA Department of Revenue's Q&amp;A on the topic.](https://revenue-pa.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/273/~/are-my-contributions-to-a-401\(k\)-plan-excluded-from-employer-withholding%3F) This could be particularly annoying if you dream of retiring in another state that does tax 401k distributions. 

The 401k contributions are still pre-tax at the federal level, however. The distributions will be taxed upon withdrawal. 

For those interested to see if your state has any similar type of tax law, [the Bogleheads website outlines specific state strategies that might not be in line with conventional /r/pf recommendations.](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/State_income_taxes#Specific_states)

I'm 18 and want to get into stocks. Any advice from successful investors?,"Edit: I intended this to be flaired as Investing

I started off my financial learning by reading How An Economy Grows And Why It Crashes by Peter Schiff. Don't know what you have to say about it (I hear some say Schiff is a doomsday lunatic), but it puts national and global economics in simple terms and got me to understand the american economy better (I'm in Portugal, btw). Plus, he predicted the housing bubble. A great first read, imo. He also briefly talks about Keynesian vs Austrian economics (he's an Austrian economist).

Then I moved onto a book that was given to me by a friend, Rich Dad, Poor Dad (and several other of the author's derivative books), and found it to be much worse. As a guide to personal finance, it teaches some basic stuff that was already kind of inherently in me. Also this guy blows real estate's dick so hard and hates stocks, but the stock market is actually what interests me the most. I later found out this guy is basically a fraud, which didn't really surprise me, because I took everything he said with a grain of salt.

I am now reading (the previous works were consumed in audiobook form, usually either at home or at the gym) How To Make Money In Stocks, by William J. O'Neill, a guy who basically analyzed the market from the 50's all the way to the 90's.  Seems to me like a very ""play it safe"" approach and the book is very technical (as opposed to the ""Rich Dad"" emotional, almost ""wanna sign up for my scheme?""-like motivational talk. I know because I've had friends fall for Ponzi/Pyramid schemes.)

Very broadly talking about what I understood about the market
1. read the financial reports. quarterly, annual, etc, look for constistent growth in the company (he says EPS is the most important, and P/E ratios are somewhat trivial) and watch out for reports that try to put a positive spin on things.
2. look for new opportunities, new directions, new products that will bring success to a company
3. look for companies with good leaders, no debt, not too many shares, and with the higher-ups actually being confident and actively buying their own stock.
4.don't go for the underdog. cheap stock price means nothing. always go for the leader and innovator in a specific market
5.look for companies that have institutional investors (the right kind of institution for you), but not too many. these guys are the ones that determine the fate of a stock.
6.watch the market trends and inspect the market daily

I will still finish this book (loving it, about 25% of the way through it), but I am looking for other books (and advice) about actual technical skills, not personal finance/motivation etc, particularly in the area of the stock market.

If you're a successful investor, tell me your story. How did you start out, what things you learned, what stocks brought you money?

I personally haven't finished high school yet and I'm not sure about going to college (theater/film, my biggest interest aside from economics).

"$7,500 credit card debit, some medical debt - best strategy for paying off on $28k/yr income","I have a question on the best strategy for paying off my credit card debt. 

Long story short, I recently graduated from college and got a job. I'm not making a lot right now but there is potential for growth at the company I work for so I am still optimistic. When I got the job, I was making $24,000/year and wanted to ""be an adult"" so I started renting my own place. 

Turns out ""being an adult"" is really fucking expensive, between paying for bills and trying to pay for food and other expenses - I found myself in tons of credit card debt (I have a great credit score so I was approved for a $12,000 limit Discover card). 

So, two years later (this spring) I swallowed my pride and moved back in with my family so I could get this debt in check and save money. 

Relevant info - I'm eternally lucky to have parents who will let my 24 year old self live at home and not pay a single dime. The only thing they ask is for help around the house. So my only debt (besides medical) is my credit card. The balance today on my cc is $7500.00 with I think 15.9% interest rate.

After taxes, company insurance premiums, and stuff like my expenses are: 

* $50 gym membership (it's the cheapest in my town and I desperately need to lose weight)
* $120-150 gas (long commute for work)
* $100 fun stuff
* $300 monthly medical bill payment

This leaves me with about $800 a month to put towards savings and my credit card. 

I make just above the minimum payments on my credit card, usually like $200 and then save the rest of the money. 

Would I be better off putting huge chunks of money towards my credit card payment and not setting any aside for savings until it is paid off? 

Or just continue paying minimum payments for years?

My discover is not universally accepted so I have to use my Visa PNC debit card. Over 5 year period, my PNC card info was stolen twice and I had to file claims to get that money back. Perhaps it was the dodgy ATMs I was using or something, but I rather not use debit card as much as I do now.

I recently tried signing a lease on an apartment and my application was denied due to lack of credit history(but my FICO score is about 780). I paid off my student loans in full in 1 year so that didn't help build my credit. 

What rewards cards do you guys recommend based on above?

Need advice paying down student loan debt,"Hello reddit. I've been lurking here in r/personalfinance for a while and I feel I should reach out here for some advice.

About me: I'm a 23 (turning 24 end of this month) year old who graduated from a UC (in 2014) with a degree in Biology. I have a pretty chill full time job at a biotech company (started in May 2015) making 33.5k/yr (however, it's probably much lower, like around 25-26k due to taxes). I graduated with a total of 32k in federal student loans, but I got it down to 29k (I feel quite proud!). What got me a bit disturbed, however, is that my mom hid the fact she had to take out private loans from Sallie Mae to help pay for my college, an amount of 7.8k with ridiculous interest rates. The reason I'm a bit mad is because 1)she never told me about them and thought last night was a good time to tell me about them and 2) she lashes out at me when I talk to her or offer to help out on finances. I've gotten over the fact that she'll never change and I've accepted the fact that these loans helped me attend and graduate college.

Anyway, here's the break down!

Nelnet:
A: 3418.17 @ 4.5% (sub loan)
B: 7752.23 @ 6.8% (unsub loan)
C: 6738.15 @ 3.4% (sub loan)
D: 4392.39 @ 3.4% (sub loan)
F: 5473.02 @ 3.86% (sub loan)
G: 2089.89 @ 3.86% (sub loan)

ACS:
~2.1k @ 5% &lt;- I'm actually not worried about this loan because I just pay $100 a month (minimum payment is $76.14), but just wanted to put it in in case you guys had any advice. I had a starting loan from ACS of 2.8k, jsyk.

Sallie Mae:
4990.32 @ 11.8%
2823.98 @ 12.38%
Minimum payments for these is ~$183

Yes, I am on IBR (because I had part-time employment during Oct 2014 - Apr 2015, but had really few hours to even afford my minimum payment) and I'm planning on re-certifying (yes, I know monthly payments will increase due to an increase in my salary).

My major expenses are:
Rent ($500/month)
Gas ($140-160/month)
Phone ($99/month)
Car Insurance ($55/month)
Student loan payments to ACS and Sallie Mae only: ~$283
Overall: ~1070 to ~1097 a month

I use YNAB (thank you based-god YNAB) to keep track of where my money goes. I thank my parents for food, so I don't eat out. Because of that, this leaves me with an extra ~1k leftover (I take whatever is left over and save it) every month. I already do have an emergency fund (~3k) in case shit hits the fans.

I really would like to put this extra 1k towards my student loans, but I don't know how to start my plan of attack. I was planning on staying on IBR so I can attack and pay off my last unsubsidized loan, and then Attack my private loans aggressively. Help me out reddit?

Buying a car for someone else...,"Hello,


To start I am located in NYC.  My family is looking to buy a new car.  I am a member of a group such that I get a large discount on the price of the car.  I wanted to run my idea past everyone to see if it makes sense:


* My father takes out a loan for the price of the car.
* I purchase the car with my discount with my credit card. (I get the discount and the points)
* My father pays me in full for the price of the car which I then use to pay off my credit card.


Does this make sense?  The only issue I might see would be the taxes involved because I might get taxed both one the initial purchase and when I transfer ownership to my father.

Is there any tax benefit of closing on a house before the end of the year?,"First time home buyer here. I'm set to close on my house in early January, but my lender told me we can likely close earlier since the only thing left to do is the appraisal.

If I'm only going to be able to deduct interest and property tax then I don't see the need to rush, because I won't have put any money towards the house (other than down payment) before the year ends anyway.

Getting Taxed Twice?,"Scenario: 
a small business. LLC, 3-partner 33% split. 

Fake 2015 numbers: 
$100k income, $40k expenses, net $60k.

That $60k gets split to the three owners $20k each and taxed. 

Now to my question:
If the LLC takes half of that $30k (to cover payroll in Jan, savings for down months etc) can it _not_ be taxed?
If it IS taxed, then essentially the 3 owners pay taxes on each of their $20k part of the net, and then put it into savings, then pay themselves in January and it gets taxed again. 

Anyone have any guidance on what a solution for this type of thing is called?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3xrgaj/getting_taxed_twice/,1450738584

20 year old in need of a new car. Unsure of what to do.,"I'll try and provide some info about myself:

* 20 years old, part time employee and full time student.

* I work ~20 hours a week, and make ~$400-550 per week. ( I wait tables..depends heavily on tips, have seen $800 a week when not in school.) I will work full time during summer break. 

* I live at home, will probably do so for the next year.

* I have ~$6,800+ saved.

* I pay $180/mo for full coverage insurance, $40/mo for my phone, $30/mo for gym membership.

* My 01 Honda Accord is dying. It's been burning oil heavily even after ~$1,200 of engine work. The trans is also starting to show early signs of wear, will likely need to be rebuilt/replaced. Not worth the repairs for a 15 year old car. 

I don't want to buy a $3-4,000 car and have the same problems repeat themselves. I was hoping someone could provide me with some input as to what decision to make..either purchasing a cheaper beater car and continuing to save (at the potential cost of reliability) or if I should buy a $8-11,000 car with a pretty hefty down payment and a 2-3 year loan. My only preference would be not having to make car payments by the time I move out..I'll be doing so for school by this time next year. 

edit: After some discussion with my parents and others, I've decided to hang onto the car for now. Yes it has issues but I can't justify getting rid of it yet. If I can squeeze another 1 or 2 years out of it, I'll have managed to save another $6-9k, quite possibly more.

Should I file as an independent on my tax returns or should my parents file me as a dependent?,"Hey guys, This is my first, of hopefully many, posts here on this sub-reddit. I'm a senior graduating from college this May. I want to start off on the right foot and develop good habits transitioning into financial independence. 

I was lucky enough to graduate with little debt and a decent job offer in May. This company that I'm working for is paying a sizable signing bonus, payable this financial year (2015). They have sent me 2015 W4 forms to complete.

One of the lines asks me whether I am claiming myself as independent. I want to know, how I could go about figuring out whether it is more financially beneficial for me to claim myself as independent or for my mom to file me as a dependent.

Here are some general numbers: 
I made about 2000 dollars from work study this year and with my bonus, I'd have a total this year of about 52k in income. My mom is currently divorced, she is making an income of 70k and is filing my sister (17) as a dependent already. 

What should I do?

EDIT: To clarify, I'm not asking whether my mom is allowed to file me as a dependent. She has paid for my college tuition and all of my living expenses this year. I'm more or less asking whether she gets more tax-benefits from doing so, then I can expect to benefits from filing as an independent.

Renting a foreclosed house that just got bought back from the bank in a public auction. What are my options?,"My Mom is the one currently renting the house so I apologize if I don't have all of the details. Our family moved into this house two years ago knowing that we would only be able to live in the house for 2-3 years before it was foreclosed on. The owner of the house stopped making payments on the house and knew in two years it would be repossessed so she decided to rent it out to us on the cheap.It's been around 2 years and the bank gave us a notice that our house was going up for auction a few weeks ago and we had a limited amount of time to move out (Beginning of January). A Realtor came to look at the house and told us he was going to try and buy our house at auction and if we were interested in continuing to rent. The auction was earlier today and the bank ended up buying the house back because I assume they thought it was undervalued. The Realtor told us just to ""wait and see"". Is it possible to continue renting the house from the bank after they won the auction or is there a chance that this Realtor can buy the house from the bank before we have to move out?

I am a full time student, employed at a bank, making $11.5 an hour--- about $600 every two weeks. 

I have outstanding credit card debit, $2k in AMEX and $400 in Discover. 

With my upcoming tax return (I file ""0"" is that correct?) and student loan refunds I am looking to what I need to do to move out and be successful. 


1. My vehicle needs maintence, new tires, rotors, coils
2. I'm expecting a solid return (between Sept-Dec from from work I've had &gt;$500 withheld in just fed taxes.)
3. I have moved out before and returned home. I want to move out this time for good and have the security net to have to come back. 


What's the best ideas for me? Thanks!

Student looking for first credit card advice,"Hello! So I'm a junior in college who will graduate with a nursing degree come May 2017. I've realized that I really do need a credit card so that I graduate with a credit score. I have federal loan debt but no private loans. Adjusting for interest it'll be around 45-50k of debt when I graduate. Nurses salaries where I leave for new grads vary from 45-50k as well. Currently the only bill in my name and not my roommates is the Comcast bill. 

I am using a car my parents own but I only get to keep it for a few months after I graduate, I don't have the money to pay cash for a car and I don't plan on saving that much (paying tuition is hard enough) so I'll need to get approved for an auto loan. Which leads to my question: what card?! I don't want a high limit (low as possible would be great, no more than $500) and as low of interest as I can get with my non existent credit score. My parents hate the idea of me getting a credit card (they think they are evil/ unnecessary) so it must be something they must sign for. I'm 20 if that makes a difference. 

Thanks everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3yqm0m/student_looking_for_first_credit_card_advice/,1451446645

I was rear-ended a week ago....curious about medical bills and insurance,"Hey everyone,

I'm hoping this doesn't fall under ""legal advice"" (which is against the rules)...if it does, then mods, feel free to remove.

&amp;nbsp;

I was stopped on the highway a week ago (traffic), when I was rear ended. The impact caused my vehicle to then hit the vehicle in front of me, although I believe the damages on that end were minimal.

I called the police, who came immediately, and they filed a police report and printed out everyone's information. I was sore, but I expected that much (whiplash, etc). 

&amp;nbsp;

Later that evening, I had a bad headache, and was a little dizzy, so I had my girlfriend wake me up about 2 hours after falling asleep, just in case I had a concussion. When she woke me up, I was disoriented, and couldn't answer her questions. I had to go to the bathroom to vomit several times, and when I came out, I was ghost white, and collapsed onto the bed. She got me dressed and immediately took me to the hospital. I was worried about going there, because I just lost my health insurance, but agreed to go, due to the nature of my symptoms.

&amp;nbsp;

At the hospital, I went through the works: CT Scan, chest x-ray, blood work, etc. Finally, the doctor (well, P.A.) came in and told me that nothing showed up on the CT Scan or x-ray results (phew!). Although I was a little irritated that she basically blamed all of my symptoms on the fact that my girlfriend woke me up. (""Well, I'm sure you're not used to being woken up just a few hours after falling asleep,"" *angry glare at girlfriend* ""so I'm sure that was a shock to you."") She told me I'd be sore for awhile, and sent me on my way. I was glad that there was no major damage.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, I got some billing info from the hospital, and went on my way. I don't think there is a total $ amount on the papers I got...perhaps that will come in the mail later.

&amp;nbsp;

My question is: since the doctor didn't think much of my symptoms, should I still be able to expect that the other driver's insurance will cover medical bills? I am not trying to bleed this person of money...but, seeing as I do not have health insurance, I'm sure that I won't be able to afford whatever the bills end up being. I am a bit worried that they will think that I went to the hospital for no reason, and thus, refuse to pay for whatever the medical bill is.

&amp;nbsp;

I should note that I *do* realize that all insurance policies are different, and that I will have to wait and see how this plays out; nonetheless, for peace of mind, I wouldn't mind getting some opinions from you guys on what I can hope to expect from this incident. I should also note that both of us (me and the other driver) have auto insurance. 

&amp;nbsp;

Any insight would be helpful. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3ylgoo/i_was_rearended_a_week_agocurious_about_medical/,1451352191
"Wife Rear-ended, offending driver's insurance not taking liability","Hi PF,

Long time lurker here, in need of advice.  This occurred roughly 3 weeks ago.  My wife's car was rear-ended and she wasn't at fault.  She was sitting in traffic and the other driver smashed into the passenger side quarter panel and rear bumper at 45mph.  The police report indicates it was the other driver's fault and pictures of the accident show skid marks from his car, positioning his car in both lanes at the time he hit the rear of my wife's car.  The insurance of the driver who hit my wife's car denied taking liability of the accident.  I am seeking any advice on limiting the financial impact this has on our lives as well as how to obtain what we have lost and anything that could pay us for the shear amount of stress this has caused us.


Lucky she was not seriously injured and we have an emergency fund which will cover our collision deductible.  We opened a claim with our insurance so we could get the vehicle repaired while waiting for the offending company to take liability. Unfortunately the decided to believe their client's lie of a story.  We are located in North Carolina which to my understanding is an at-fault state and two insurance companies must agree to who's fault it was.  My company agrees with me that it was the other driver's fault.


Right now this has impacted us by:

 * Medical costs (HDHP, HSA funded) for my wife's immediate visit to the doctor for pain medication and Physical therapy - Should be reimbursed by my current claim from my insurance
 * Collision Deductible $1000
 * Diminished value of the vehicle (Hire an adjuster/lawyer if ""at-fault"" insurance company will not settle) - vehicle was a new 2015 vehicle
 * Lost wages ($1000, wife could not go to work and lost wages for several days)
 * Pain and suffering (Not sure how to value this but the stress of this event and the subsequent insurance company not taking fault has been extremely stressful)
 * Bad faith of the insurance company (Not sure if we can sue for this, but it's pretty bluntly obvious who's fault this accident is, could we sue the insurance company for not doing the right thing too?)


In short, do any PFer's have advice on how to re-coup the above values?  Is there anything else I should be thinking about?  We believe we are at the point of requiring a lawyer but figured I'd ask here for any other advice.  What would a laywer cost?  Can I add the cost of the lawyer to the above since they are costing my wife and I's time and money now?  Can I take the driver to small claims court for anything else?  


Any other's who went through something similar and can elaborate on the most PF way to handle this would be very helpful.

Happy holidays all and I hope you this doesn't happen to you.

23 Just left Uni to start a f/t job (AUS),"Hi, I'm a graduate engineer that has recently gotten a full time job earning 60k a year(on 40 hour weeks), with a potential to earn more if I do more hours during the busy periods. Currently My job has offered me good hours, with the implied average of at least 40 hours a week, and up to 60. Also I have no currently outstanding debt, apart from my HECS fees

I currently live at home with my girlfriend and am thinking about my options in investing/saving and spending with this sort of money. As well as the possibility of moving out and buying a property and or (second hand) 4wd.

I own roughly 8-9k in stocks, have a 8-9k car which I'm going to sell (and drive my GF's bomb), with nothing in savings. And have roughly gotten away with about $300-350 weekly spending. Now I am no means a professional trader on the ASX, I just buy and sit on something usually. Meaning I have a potential saving of roughly 500-600 a week. Having around say 16k in assets and $500/w in savings.


I've never exactly made this kind of money before, or come across it, and I'm not exactly one to be a great saver, and liked be told what to do or how to spend. But now that I am earning something substantial I thought I'd seek advice of how to better distribute my cash flow and how to invest/trade properly. And want to really start spending wisely and learn what habits to adopt. And whether and what I should do if I should begin saving for a home or a  home.

Help with Student Loan repayment!,"Hi r/personalfinance,

I am a 26 year old college grad with $48,000 in student debt. I currently live with my parrents and I am about to start a job that pays $30,000 - $40,000 depending on bonuses and raises. I have little to no expenses being that I live at home. I was wondering what the best way to go about paying my student loans would be.

My original plan was to work for a year straight and take as much out of them as possible. Thinking if i make the bare minimum of $30,000, take $5,000 out for personal expenses, i could cut my loans in half by this time next year and sort of repeat the process the year after if I can still bare living at home by that time. 

Another avenue I was contemplating was to split my income, invest half and use the other half to pay of the loans. Any advice would be great! I majored in Geography but I'm giving it my all to lift myself out of debt and live as financially responsible as possible in the future.  

Loan Details Below;


Total Loans: $47,270

Subsidized Loans: $23,584   @   4.00%  

Unsubsidized Loans: $23,868    @  6.5%

Based on my current re-payment plan of around $500 dollars, the total amount of the loan after 10 years would be $60,000.

I suffer from kidney stones. Been pain free for a few months only to be told I've got 5 whoppers between both kidneys. Odds are significantly against passing them without medical intervention.

Each side will cost 8k$. I'm responsible for 20%. That means if I do 1 now before eoy I pay 1600. I don't have to do it now though and can wait till the new year or later but the deductible resets.

Next year to do the other side I get hit with the full amount to deductible which I want to say us 2500, then 20%.

I've already exhausted hcra funds for this year, so I would be paying medical post tax.

I have a son needing surgery as well to the tune of 6k.

Kidney stone pain is... Bad. I've had 50+ and the size of these terrify me. Doctors are much more hesitant to prescribe high strength pain killers and you know the little bastard's will light me up on a weekend.

"My father, who is deep in debt, is asking for a loan from me to fund something called ""PayPal Working Capitol"". Can someone familiar with this explain how it works, or is he lying to me?","My father has been going around to everyone in family asking for loans, which he got from us all over the past 6 months. He has been incredibly irresponsible financially and has racked up huge CC debt. He failed to repay the loans that were made to him by me and the rest of my family. 

Today he called me and practically begged me for over 2 hours on the phone to get me to loan him another 20K to get his CC payments under control. If he doesn't do it this month he is going to default on all his cards. I have no idea how much debt he has but it's massive. I told him that I would not loan him any money because he has lied in the past too many times and not fulfilled his promises, and has no plan whatsoever to get his finances under control other than to ""give him whatever I can"" so he can stay afloat. 

I admit he got to me emotionally, but still I told him no 30 times and gave him my reasons, that I just don't trust I will ever see my money again. At the end he said he had an alternative solution. His business is selling stuff on ebay. He says he makes around 10K a month profit doing so. I do believe this is true and he has offered to show me proof of his business income. He says if I loan him $10,000 to put in his paypal account he can use something called ""Paypal Working Capitol"" to get him a loan another $6,000 for him to pay his cards for the month so he doesn't default. He swears he will have my 10K back in one weeks time as soon as the money clears from paypal. I told him that if he can really get me the money back in one week I will do it. He said that he will call paypal in the morning and get everything setup. I told him I would like to listen in on the call to make sure everything is on the level. He said OK but seemed a little taken back, which got me suspicious. 

After I hung up I researched Paypal Working Capitol. It seems it's a loan that uses a percentage of your yearly sales to give you money with no credit check. I have yet to find anything that says you need to use funds in your account to do the loan. Now I am thinking, has he bullshitted me again so he can get this ""loan"" from me? I can't believe he would do this. Now maybe there is something I am missing here, so I am giving him the benefit of the doubt and asking here.

Does anyone who knows about this paypal loan program know if a loan like this would be needed to get him money from the Paypal ""working capitol"" program? Or has he lied to me yet again? I really want to believe him but his past history tells me he will say anything to get the money.

Thanks!

Recently, I had a random stranger ( I know I was drunk and was not thinking clearly at that time) put in two checks into my account. One had $400 on it (all signed and said to whom) and the other had $400 (not signed, unvaild..).

I found out yesterday that it was actually the money that was being pulled out that night, but since one of the checks were invalid, it was pulled from my savings on that card. 

The bank is sending me back that invalid check. So the question is, can I get my money back from that invalid check?

When I bought my house, I took the money out and used it as a down payment. By that time, it had grown to nearly the amount the irs is asking for. 

When I bought my house, my dad had to fill out some paperwork signing the money over to me, and saying that it was a gift even though it was my money. The irs is now counting it as unclaimed income, and would like me to pay taxes on it.

Did I get my buy/lease math right?,"I'm over 6 years on my current car, with a recent need for service that'll cost nearly 50% of my remaining KBB value. As a result, while I may keep my car for another year or so, it's finally time to start planning the next one; I, like many, can't afford to be without wheels for a while.

So I made a quick spreadsheet to check how bad it might be. I found various articles that have ""average depreciation per year"", and then did a quick ""repeating pattern"" that has the following three cases:

1) Lease for three years (depreciating 42%), paying for 58%. For a car of cost ""100*X"" (to make percent easy), you end up putting out 1.6X per month.

2) Buy for 48 months, then sell immediately, paying all 100X, but getting back 49X later. The effective monthly outlay is then 1.06X.

3) Buy for 72 months (6 years), then sell immediately, getting back 39X. The monthly effective outlay is then 0.91X.

It's staggering. Now, this doesn't account for lease vs buy finance rates, not quite getting the full residual when you sell, etc, but it seems staggering.  Did I mess something up? Is it seriously this bad? Where is my math wrong?

"Need to negotiate moving package, Boston--&gt; Chicago","I was given the wonderful opportunity through my current job to relocate from Boston, where we are headquartered, to open up a new office in downtown Chicago. Professionally, it should be a great experience, and I’m excited to move outside of the northeast for the first time.


Originally my boss and I had planned on being in Chicago for April 1, but recently I was asked if I would consider moving out earlier, and to come up with a proposal for a moving package. I’ve checked the forums but couldn’t seem to come up with anything, and I need to have the beginnings of a proposal for tomorrow (eek).


My question: what is appropriate to propose as part of a moving package? I do not have a great understanding of what the company would typically pay for vs what I would pay for.  


Here is what I have so far, but would love to know if there is anything I’m missing, or if any of these seem unreasonable:


•	Cost of movers (pros to pack up and deliver my things to the new place) – I have estimates between $1700-$2000
•	Buy out of current lease in Boston – would total around $3.5k - $5k (this is something they have said they would be willing to do)
•	Car shipping costs (~$500) OR cost to drive my own car out there ($300-$500)
•	Cost of living salary increase is N/A, as cost of living in Chicago is roughly equal to or less than that of living in Boston 
•	Realtor’s fee (if applicable) for new place in Chicago (likely 1 months rent, between $1200-$1500 ideally)


As background, I work for a tech startup, currently earning $85k salary/year  + quarterly bonus (TBD), but have been promised a promotion and salary increase (amount also TBD) with the move. I am single, no children.

Thoughts on Roth IRA for house down-payment?,"So I have been seriously considering buying a house in my area but currently don't really have the on-hand cash I would need for a down-payment on things. I haven't been out of college very long, 1.75 years, so it's not that I'm not saving, it is just that my saving has been going towards emergency funds, retirement funds, etc I just haven't had the time frame to save the appropriate amount of money for a house, I'm otherwise happy with my budget and the amount of money I am saving.

So with that said, I understand you can use up to $10k  from an IRA as a first-time home buyer on a house, and that seems really tempting for me. Is this generally a good move or are there hidden issues with it that would end up hurting me in the long run?

I plan on staying in the area, it's just that rent is kind of high here, at least when compared to purchasing in the area. From what I'm seeing it looks like I could buy something significantly nicer than any of the apartments for rent and have the same or lower monthly payments then renting.

22 and still living with parents. What should I do.,"Im a full time student, and working full time with frequent overtime.
I make around $1,700 a month, zero debt, and about 8k in savings. I pay for everything except for utilities,rent. My phone,food,insurance,gas,etc ends up costing maybe $250 a month. (my employer provides free meals while at work) So I net about $1,450 a month. I also have a good credit score. My car has 190k miles on it, and its payed off, but its falling apart fast as well. Im eventually going to have to move out though, and im not sure if its going to be on my own or my parents kicking me out soon. Im not buying a new car either, but I may need a new used car in the future.

Need some advice with my debt payoff plans.,"I recently changed jobs and got myself a nice raise in income. I'm now looking to take that extra money and pay down my debt for good. Here are the numbers:
My take home pay is roughly $3800/mo
I have $5K in savings
My household expenses come to approx $1000/mo
Car loan at 1.9% is $410/mo bal is $12900 owed
Credit cards are at $14K. Majority of balance is at 0% for the next year.
Student loan payment is $380/mo and carries a $26K balance at 3.4% var 

My dilemma... I recently received a balance transfer offer from one of my credit cards for 0% for 14mos and 2% in fees. I'm wondering if I should take advantage of that to pay off the car loan and add that $410 to the monthly pool of extra cash for paying down the rest of my debts or if I should carry on as I have been and dumping every last cent I find into paying off my credit cards first before moving on to the next item to pay off. 

This is really my first opportunity in a very long time to start paying these debts off in a timely manner and I'm making a promise to myself to not screw this up. I've played around with the numbers a bit and if I stay true, I can have just about everything paid off in two years. 

If I use the transfer option I realize that my credit utilization is going to shoot up a bit. I'm currently at around 16%. 
I realize this would simply be moving the debt around but ultimately does it make sense to pay the loan off first and free up that payment to be applied elsewhere?

I forgot to add the possibility of paying off the student loans first. Since that does (at this point) have the highest interest rate.

[budgeting] Help budget £1000+,"So ive already created a budget and wanted some input on it. Here is my budget:

I've decided to stick with £400 for 11 weeks and putting the rest away into savings account. The money is there for emergency's.  


So i did 400/11 = £36.36. That is my weekly budget. From there I've put £25.00 for groceries, and the remaining £11.36 is for ""fun"". Although I've put a note up in my spreadsheet saying try to put that money in my savings account if possible.  


I've also gone ahead and created one for the summer term. Im getting roughly £1,000 and the term is only 5 weeks although i will only be on campus for about 3/4. Ive decided to put £800 into my savings and keep £200 in my current account.  


200/4 = £50.00 a week  


£25 for food and the remaining £25 for ""fun"". Since this will be term for exams i will probably not be going out much and will most likely save that extra £25.00.  


Also i will need to put a deposit on a house for next year so that is roughly £300 from my savings. Which leaves with £900.  


EDIT: I usually do my grocery shopping in Aldi as its usually quite cheap. Also i have a job right now which i'll make about £300 before heading off to university. This will probably be put into savings. I am also looking for a job in my university town, so if i find one i will put roughly £10 into my weekly budget.

"Possibly scammed over $23,000 and extremely worried about","Just for the record I’ve been a reddit ghost for almost two years now, never posted anything, commented or even had an account. I would always just read. Currently I have a serious situation and reddit always seem to try and help. Right now I need all the help I can get.

I looked up some auction sites because I was interesting in buying a car in an auction and saving some money. I came across AuctionAutoUsa. Everything checked out, they seemed legitimate.  I’ve been saving up for years now and finally decided now is the time to buy a car.  I signed up for an account. Right away a vehicle caught my eye and the down payment required prior to bidding was $2300 because the car was most likely going to go for over $20,000. 

After a few days they called me and we started the bid. To my surprise we won the car I wanted :D
The winning bid was $23,600. I then wired them the rest of the money from my local bank account. (In Canada) 
They then called me a few days after and said there was problem with the current owner of the car and he did not pay some fees to copart (Where the cars are held) Long story short the car deal got cancelled.  I understand things like this happened and I accepted it. 

We then bid and won another vehicle. I watched them bid for me on copart so it was authentic. (AuctionAutousa is basically a third hand man that bids for people on auction sites in case people do not have a dealer license). 

I then drove all the way to Houston from Hamilton (Over 22 Straight Hours)  to pick up the new car that I’d won with AuctionAuto. ( They are located in pennsylvania but the internet auction they were doing for me was in Texas). 
After I arrived in texas they called me again to let me know the agent on behalf of their company that bid for me got fired because of some internal issues and the cars he bid on did not register. All this came to light after I arrived in Texas. I then asked for a refund and they agreed. 

Its been almost a month now and still not refund. Whenever I call they ignore, whenever I send an email they ignore. One guy finally replied and said he does not work for them and that I had his personal number should stop messaging him. He also said they are going out of business and the owner was out of the country…

I have no idea what to do. I went to the Hamilton police and they literally laughed and said I should not have tried purchasing a car online, so I thanked them and left. The problem is 23000USD is close to 30000CAD, I been working a long time for that and that’s literally all I had and was saving it for a car because I love cars.  What should I do? Call the FBI, CIA, RCMP, Mall Cop, Marine Corp, Army? 
Any help or tips would greatly be appreciated. Also a side note these guys all had Russian accents and are Russian I’m 99% sure. If they just take my money and leave the country after filing for bankruptcy the money pretty much gone isn’t it.. 

Edit
I called a car company that is near there location and they said its in fact a real company and they purchased over 50 cars from them alone. However the last 2 months they been really slow in payments and they have issues with about 20 cars.  What I think is going on is that this company did exist and was fully operational at one point, thing starting going downhill and now they are just taking everyone's money and bailing.. So essentially a real company that turned into a scam.

edit: word choice

----------------------

Edit 2: Okay, since a couple people have asked what my specific questions are, I'll add a bit more detail. First, my main question is HOW IN THE HELL AM I EVER GOING TO PAY THESE SUCKERS OFF?

Here's the gist: I have 2 federal loan servicers with multiple loans under each servicer, and 1 private loan servicer. I had another private loan under a different servicer but I defaulted on it and it went to collections a few years ago. I defaulted because when I graduated they hiked my interest up from 5% to something like 11 or 13% so I was paying several hundred dollars a month to just maintain my debt and they were unwilling to work with me. 

Most of my debt is Federal Stafford loans, and most of them are at 6-6.8% fixed interest. My private loan I haven't defaulted on seems the least harmful at 4% interest (variable though). I haven't been in contact with the collection agency in months, and I'm a little worried that one will come and lash out at me soon. 

The other loans I have are currently in good standing, but I'm barely chipping away at my debt considering I'm on IBR plan on all but my private 4% loan which I am paying back at standard repayment. So for some of my federal loans I'm barely paying anything, and on others I'm paying but my payments aren't even covering the interest they accrue for the month. 

The whole thing is so complicated and I feel like I need someone to sit down with me and look at the mess I'm in and give me a step by step process for how to most effectively pay down this debt. Right now I can't pay much more than what I am paying (my monthly payments are about $450), but I am considering moving back to my hometown to LIVE WITH MY MOTHER... ugh... in order to pay faster. If I'm going to do that I want to know the quickest and most effective way to pay off the most amount of debt possible. Gotta make that time count for something. I feel like I'm sending myself off to jail. 

Any advice? Hope this helps.

Edit 3: Monthly budget. I bartend so a lot of my budget varies from month to month in terms of business and tips. 

Cash tips per week: 240-390

Paycheck every two weeks: ~$300

Monthly income: $1560-$2160

Rent: $650

Utilities: None

Car Insurance: $127

Gas: $60

Minimum monthly credit card payment: $100 (Only have 1 card with $3,000 balance)

Food: $250

Entertainment: $150

Pet care: $50

Gym/Fitness (I ACTUALLY USE THIS): $60

Private loan #1: $176

Federal Loan Servicer #1: $89

Federal Loan Servicer #2: $185



Total: $1797

So, basically, since I feel like I live from week to week because I have no savings, and my ""fat"" weeks make up for the ""lean"" weeks in tips, it seems like I barely make enough to scrape by. Maybe I should be spending less on food? I eat at home almost every meal, and I don't waste much. But I do buy organic stuff because I think it's better for me.

I have zero savings, and no real emergency fund.

Student Loan Debt - Help Needed,"Ok so I recently won a lawsuit against the late Sallie Mae now Navient. I had about 22k left in student loan debt. Anyways they had to pay out to me around 5k and were suppose to pull my loans out of default as they were wrongly put in.

 Now just yesterday my credit score got hit and it showed my student loans in there. They were closed and a derogatory account. Now my question is because I was given a few different answers. Someone said if they are closed I no longer have to pay and just wait for it to fall off in 7 years. But if I fight to get that derogatory off I will have to pay them back in full.

Im confused as I do not have a lot of knowledge on this, and I thought they were suppose to be pulled out and put in good standing after the lawsuit.

What to do with a comics creating/publishing business? (EGY),"Hello, I'm an Egyptian cartoonist (and dentist) with 4 years of experience including published works both online and in print as well as participating in various exhibitions inside and outside of Egypt.  

A bit of context: I started publishing my work online on a blog 4 years ago and gradually gained a large audience on twitter and facebook. I started publishing a serialised comics magazine in November 2014, with funding from an art support organisation.  


Currently, that group wants to end their fiscal year and are closing down on my project. They said they need to cover for their losses and they offered to sell my unsold comic issues to me (for a price that is a bit more than what would cost me to reprint them), their consensus is that the comic project wouldn't die and that I'd be responsible for it myself. I am not a business oriented person and not sure what to make out of this. Kindly advise.   


Extra info:   6 issues were made, the issues sold were around 40% of the printed issues.  Comic is also being sold digital, however in the arab world paying for digital content is not common.  Publishing houses in the middle east are not risk takers and shy away from printing comics, the chance that one of them takes up my project is small. The percentage of comic readers in Egypt is relatively small (to say America), but they are very passionate about it.

Why I chose to invest (yes invest) in Bitcoin beginning in 2013 and why I continue to do so.,"Hi All,

I hope this post is informative.

In January 2013 I discovered Bitcoin and was fascinated by it when I learned what it is and how it works. To begin, let me break down what Bitcoin is on a very basic level (the minimum most will need to understand of Bitcoin)

**Basic**: Bitcoin, to you and me and your family, is essentially digital cash that can be sent to whomever you want, whenever you want, anywhere in the world. It is very important to make this distinction, because with a Bank you need to ask for permission to do all the above. With Bitcoin, you just do it - and it's done.

**More Detailed**: Bitcoin is finite in nature, meaning that there are a limited amount of Bitcoins that exist and will be created over the next 100 years or so. This is important to note compared to traditional banking which has no limit. This, to some, has made it very appealing to investors. There is discipline with Bitcoin that can't change so easily just because of human emotions.

Bitcoin is currently the most powerful computer network (literally) in the whole world, meaning it makes it much more resistant to ""computer attacks"" of the sort, which prevents the network being taken over by bad actors.

Additionally, all of the Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, called ""the blockchain"". Approximately every 10 minutes, the powerful computers running the Bitcoin source code confirm that transactions are legitimate, and the transactions are then ""stamped"" into the blockchain, becoming a verifiable record that this transaction took place, making it very, VERY hard to forge. (Many millions of dollars of very sophisticated equipment needed to ATTEMPT a forgery). This is very important, because for the first time in history someone (lets say the most dishonest person in the world) can send a transaction directly to you, and after it is confirmed the person CANNOT take the transaction away from you. He also cannot send you ""copies"" of the money, as the network will no allow it. Essentially now you can do business with the biggest thief in the world, and not have to worry about whether the funds he sent you will be forged or ""charged back."" This is a very important distinction of Bitcoin.

The above reasons are why I invested in Bitcoin, and why I continue to do so. It is very powerful to realize that people can hold money (digital cash) on their phone, and have 100% complete ownership of that digital cash, without having to rely on a ""promise"" of a bank to pay out when they want to make a withdrawal. It's very powerful stuff.

The network effect of Bitcoin continues to build, and the network continues to get more powerful. If you don't have a use for Bitcoin right now, that's okay! There's nothing wrong with that. However with the many Billions across the world I guarantee that there are people that do have a use for it, and since Greed works in conjunction with how the network is built and how it functions, I think Bitcoin will continue to flourish. 

That is why I decided to invest (and use) Bitcoin in my daily life ever since. Bitcoin is an OPEN SOURCE protocol that anybody can build services onto. This isn't one company we're talking about, this is tens of thousands of entrepreneurs finding uses for this protocol.

Because of Bitcoin we will continue to see more competition in remittance and the payments space. You will also see more and more people using Bitcoin as a savings asset as they are finite in nature, and easy to transport.

Citi closed one of my credit card accounts without warning,"Some background: 31 years old, excellent credit history since age 18. Right now I'm around a 825 fico score depending on which bureau you ask which do of the week.  
My first credit card was with citi around age 18 or 19. Ive opened various other credit cards that get me good cash back or rewards and never carry a balance. I typically do not close revolving balance accounts as I've understood that having a good outstanding balance to available credit limit ratio was in my favor. One card I have (had, now) with citi was a rather low limit card ($2600) that I used to use a long time ago when it gave me 5% on gas. That went a away long ago so I stopped using the card, stuck it in my safe and resigned it to be used in the case of some major emergency. (Not that I didn't have over 20x that I could access on other cards)

I wake up to an email from citi this morning saying that they've closed the account. I assume from inactivity. I call and they confirm my assumption. I asked if they could transfer that credit line to my other account. They said they could not and to do so would require inquiries on my credit to either re-open the account or request a credit line increase on my existing account. 

I told them that this is unacceptable as they have lowered my denominator without my consent. (Though I'm sure there are stipulations in the card member agreement saying they can do so for exactly the reasons they mention). My assertion is that they have wronged me and need to make me whole. They had nothing further they could do for me at this point. 

My questions are:

1. Is this actually going to have any impact? (I assume not - but I'm still annoyed)
2. What matters of recourse should I take - if anything just to ruffle their feathers a bit?

TL;DR: citi closed my credit card with a very small credit line I hadn't been using in a long time and I'm annoyed. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3vs9wr/citi_closed_one_of_my_credit_card_accounts/,1449492652

What to invest in for my IRA that I can't get in TSP (US Government employee 401k equivalent)?,"The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is wonderful! Extremely low cost (.029% expense ratio), decent fund choices, and employer matching (thanks to your tax dollars). However, I also have a Vanguard IRA.

G - Treasuries issued directly to TSP (no equivalent)

F - Matches Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index

C - Matches Standard and Poor's 500 (S&amp;P 500) Index

S - Matches Dow Jones U.S. Completion Total Stock Market Index

I - Matches MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Index

Mostly in S/C/I for the TSP. For the IRA I have a small percentage in Vanguard's REIT (VNQ), and the rest in Total Stock Market (VTI). I'm considering moving a small percentage to Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets (VWO) to fill in some of the gaps in the TSP's I Fund (which is also missing Canada).

I have a $150 a month car payment for the next 4 years.
Other expenses (car insurance, internet, utilities, etc) are about $550.
No CC debt, no student loans.

$5500 in savings.
130k in 401k (federal gov't employee so TSP)
I put about $13k a year into my 401k.

I need to save money to pay for a new AC system in my house and general repairs.  Would like to have about 10k to do this.  

I use mint to track my spending and while I spend about $200 a month on “shopping” (which is mostly amazon for stuff I either want/need) consistently and I will spend anywhere from $500 to $1000 a month on groceries/food total.  A lot of that can be going out on dates and what not but that seems to be where my issues are.  
Should I cut back on my 401k to save up for repairs?  Or just slowly build up my savings to do it?

Deciding between Seattle area and NYC,"About me: New grad in May 2016, Male, student debt at ~80k. I'm incredibly flexible at this point in my life. I am not tied down to anything and really all I'm looking to do is get rid of my student loans and achieve strong financial security. I do value living in a city since I'm so young and need easier access to nightlife and people.

I have a job offer with a tech company in Seattle and I'm still interviewing with a couple companies in NYC. For the first 4 years in Seattle my taxable income will fall at ~130k. There is no state tax which is awesome, and though the property is slightly more expensive, I am single and can probably find a nice place to rent at 1,500/month. 

I am also in the interview process with a company in NY and I am wondering if it is financially disadvantageous to take this offer if I do get it. What I expect is an annual taxable income of 180k when 30k of that is from bonus. So in NY there is a state tax and city tax which fall at annual rates of 6.65 and 3.6 respectively (i believe) with average rent being 3k, I think I would probably look for either a roommate or just bite the bullet on a higher rent like 3.5k/month just for the opportunity to live in the city.

My NY formula looks like (180000 - (180000 * (.036 + .0665))) - (3500 * 12) = 119550 not accounting for federal tax, medicare, 401k contributions, and anything else i'm forgetting

My Seattle formula looks like (130000 - (1500 * 12)) = 112000 not accounting for the same things plus 15k of that comes from from capital gains which gets taxed for 15% and 3.x% for obamacare I believe...

Somehow I feel like 130k in seattle should go much further than 180k in NYC but I'm not really sure what else to account for other than rent and state/city income tax.

What does pf think? Which seems like a smart offer to take, and if the Seattle offer is better, what amount of money in NYC can give the same standard of living as what I would have in Seattle?

"Paying off my loans using a credit card, encountering issues","Hey r/personalfinance, 

I'm going to start paying back my loans soon, and have allotted a $700/month amount as a base (could go up with bonuses I receive from my job). I have about $32k in debt, the majority of it being federal subsidized and unsubsidized loans. Nearly 5k of it is Perkins loans. 

Here's where things get tricky, though. As opposed to paying them off with my bank account, I want to use credit cards to pay them off. I'm getting into low-level churning, and basically treating my credit card as a debit card to earn rewards and the like. Unfortunately, I've got some issues:

1. Navient has me capped at $301/month payment with card. Anything after that must be taken out of my bank account. I saw some people on a FICO forum saying that Navient raised the minimum after the first month of payment and another request, but I wanted to make sure this was in fact true. 

2. Perkins loans, done through ECIS, are a bit trickier. I can pay off whatever amount I wish, but there's a mandatory 3.95 percent or so charge. I calculated how much extra I'd be spending on charges after paying off these loans, and it comes out to around $181. I don't want to spend $181 on an arbitrary cost, and I know that paying these loans off faster would ultimately reduce that annoying card charge. 

3. I would love to apply windfall to my loans, but Navient makes it so that your minimum (in my case, $300) is distributed evenly across the loans. Anything after that, which is deducted from your bank account, can target a specific loan. 

So, lots of different factors here. I kinda messed up and got Navient to change my IBR plan to a standard plan before checking the ECIS fees. I'm thinking I may just switch back to an IBR plan for Navient, and just pay off however much that is per month while putting more toward the loans with the attached fees. 

What are your thoughts? Any suggestions on tackling this? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3weemv/paying_off_my_loans_using_a_credit_card/,1449854534
Selling stock as short term loss for tax deduction,"Hi guys, first post from a relatively new member here.

I bought about $80k of berkshire hathaway 6 months ago before i discovered /pf and now that I've been enlightened here, I want to move that to a 3 fund portfolio. It's down about $5k so i was thinking about taking a deduction for short term loss there. My only other taxed stock transactions are shares of my employer that I sell periodically for long term capital gains. So apparently my short term loss would cancel out against these long term gains, effectively meaning the deduction is worth 15% instead of my 28% income tax rate? If I want my full 28% deduction, I should wait to sell my BRK after new years so that it's in 2016 and then I can't sell any of my company shares during all of 2016 so that I don't recognize any long term gains. And even then only $3k of the losses can be deducted against my ordinary income per year, so the rest needs to be carried over to 2017 and  I can't sell any company shares for 2 years. Is that right?

For an extra 13% savings on about $5k, that's worth about $700, so I have to decide whether that's worth the trouble.

Is this all correct? Is there anything else I'm missing or not considering? Thanks in advance!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3y034m/selling_stock_as_short_term_loss_for_tax_deduction/,1450902259

"29 y/o male- Help navigating health insurance- VERY low income, don't qualify for a subsidy OR Medicaid.","Someone please help me understand all of this.

I'm a 29 year old male, making about $10,000 in 2015 and I live in Florida.

I lost my job in January and I have been on the hunt since- picking up odd jobs at every opportunity.

I just went through the application process on Healthcare.gov and it says I'm not eligible for a subsidy because I make too little.

I'm also not eligible for Medicaid because I am not 'either pregnant, a parent or relative caretaker of a dependent child(ren) under age 19, blind, have a disability or a family member in your household with a disability, or be 65 years of age or older.'

The premiums for the catastrophic plans are still coming in at $169/mo. Bronze plans get up over $200/mo.

I can't afford it. I can barely afford to keep the lights on, let alone $200 a month for health insurance.

I keep seeing these commercials for the marketplace with people who look like me and are getting coverage for $57 or whatever. I'm really frustrated. I just want to do the right thing.

Is my only option to find the money or go uninsured?

Feel like it's too late for me. Can you convince me I'm wrong?,"I frequent this subreddit often and am so impressed with all the young (teens and early 20s) redditors asking for advice and doing so well for their age. I'm not particularly old but I feel like I'm late in the game when it comes to retirement planning.

A little about me... I'm a 29 year old female married to a 31 year old. I make 60k a year before taxes. My husband probably makes 70-80k (he just started his own company as an electrician and hvac contractor). 

When we first started dating, we both owned our own home. I sold mine recently and used that money to purchase a 2.5 acre lot and a new home with my husband. So now we own 2 homes and some property. 

Our goal is to eventually build our ""forever"" home on that 2.5 acre lot by selling our two other homes (both fixer uppers). Besides our mortgage, we are both debt free which is a great feeling. We both have about $15,000 in a emergency fund savings account. However, we do not have a retirement plan set up. 

Oh yes, I'm also pregnant with my first child! We'd like to have 2 kids and already plan on setting up a college fund for each of them as soon as possible.

Ideally, we'd like to retire early. (Early 50s would be great! 40s would be even better...). Is that feasible at this point? If so, any advice on how to make that happen? 

Thank you in advance.

PSA: You Probably Don't Need a Financial Advisor,"Lots of people coming to /r/personalfinance ask if they need a financial advisor or if they should keep their existing one.  The answer is nearly always a resounding ""NO.""

People with simple situations - an income, some debt, a 401k/IRA, and normal expenses - don't need to pay someone to manage their money.  **The more people with their hands in your figurative pots, the less money you end up with.**  People that are in this situation should read the information found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq), particularly [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). 

If you are paying an advisor already and are unsure of whether or not you should keep them, or if their decisions are good ones, ask yourself the following questions:

* Does my/can my situation fit into  [""I Have $[X] ... What Do I Do With It?!""](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)  If so, you probably don't need an advisor.

* Is my advisor **fee-only** (not ""fee-based"")?  If not, they are not obligated to make decisions that are in *your* best interests.  You should at least find a new, **fee-only** advisor, or stop paying one entirely.

* Is my advisor pitching products at me?  A great sign you've got a bad advisor is if they're recommending financial products like permanent (universal, whole, indexed universal, etc) life insurance plans, annuities, or mutual funds with loads.  None of these products have a place in most people's financial portfolios.  If your advisor is recommending any of these things they are likely just salespeople, whose goal is to transfer your money to them.

* Did a potential advisor cold call you?  Is a ""friend of a friend"" just starting at NWM and offering to sell insurance?  If so, they're only looking to make a commission on selling you crappy financial products.  Avoid.

**Managing your finances is not difficult.**  There are plenty of resources available for free on the interwebs if you don't want to look at the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/faq), and a [reading list](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/readinglist) if you want an analogue version.  You don't need to pay anyone to list your debts in order of interest rate, tell you to take advantage of your employer match, or that you shouldn't carry credit card debt.  

**There are situations in which seeking a fee-only, fiduciary financial advisor (or other financial professional) is a good idea.**  Complicated inheritances, very large windfalls, estate planning, expatriate finances and taxation, and other complicated tax issues may warrant hiring such a professional.  

**tl;dr** - make sure you're saving for your own retirement, not helping a financial salesperson save for theirs.

"Health insurance denied a claim, but no patient responsibility on EOB","So, I recently saw a surgeon at Virginia Mason who ordered a CT scan. My insurance deductible (Group Health) is all paid up and no one mentioned getting pre-authorization for this. I went to my insurance's website a few days later and noticed claims totaling 3500 that had been denied due to no pre-authorization being sought. 

After a few calls to VM and GH, Group Health noted that the ""patient responsibility"" line is $0 and my doctor was supposed to seek pre-authorization, therefore making the treatment a ""provider write-off"". I haven't received a bill from VM for the CT scan yet, but am concerned that  they might pass on this cost to me. I am unsure whether I signed a contact (along with my consent to treatment) making me financially responsible for the treatment. 

I know that I've made some mistakes here by not being more careful, but a series of tests were ordered very quickly and I am pretty new to being insured on my own. 

I'm basically wondering what the provider's (VM's) standard operating procedure will be. Will they dispute this with GH or come after me? Does anyone have experience in this area? I'm told that I can be billed at any time during the next 18 months. 

I'm also wondering about next steps - should I wait for a bill or make further contact with VM about it? I don't want to invite them to bill me in any way, since this appears to be a dispute between two (wealthy) giants. 

TL;DR: Health insurance claim denied because not pre-authorized, insurance says that the provider should write it off, worried they'll come after me.

"I'm finally on top of my finances, but have no idea what to do next","Hello /r/personalfinance.  Just wanted to take a moment to say thank you.  I'm an active contributor to the sub, and you've helped me change my life around from someone in $10,000 in credit card debt to someone with a budget, savings, retirement, and aiming for /r/financialindependence.

I finished up my approximate 2016 budget yesterday, and everything looks to be in order.  [High-level picture included](http://imgur.com/jF30hob).  I have a much more detailed breakdown but that's not really relevant to this post.  My information breakdown is as follows:

* Income - About $45000 after tax and insurance

* Expenses - All mandatory bills, from rent to internet.  I've gone over them with a fine-tooth comb, there's nothing I'm willing to sacrifice, save for maybe $200 in an emergency.

* Other - Non-mandatory expenses, I'm much more flexible here
 * Retirement - Maxed out IRA, Maxed out employer match, nothing extra

 * Debts - $8500 car at 3%, $65000 (federal) student loans at ~6%

 * Savings - This is flexible money that can be dumped into any category, including upgrading my E-fund.  My buffer for financial mistakes is also included in here.

With this breakdown, I should be debt-free with an ~90k retirement in 7 years (early 30's), assuming no major changes.

**QUESTION:**

Am I done?  Is the breakdown about in line with what it should be?  What do I do next?  Can I improve on anything at a high level, and if so, what?

Debt collection for a service provided 2 years ago,"I'm sorry if this post is a little disorganized, but I'm a little flustered right now. I just received a phone call from a debt collecting agency claiming that I owe $1,500 from a gym membership that I signed up for 2 years ago (June 2013). Long story short, a new gym was opening up in my town, and they had a promotional ""pre-opening"" sale where there was no registration fee. Me, being a scrawny recent high-school graduate with my summer job at a convenient store, decided a gym membership would be a worthy investment. Now the thing is, the gym never officially opened while I was there. They were still setting up the equipment and let me lift whatever they had when I stopped by.



2 months later, I went off to college. Realizing that I wouldn't be able to use the gym, I emailed them about the possibility of freezing my account so I wouldn't have to pay the monthly fee while I was at school (I signed up for a plan where the more you visit per month, the less you pay). They never responded. I figured since I signed up with a now discontinued debit account, it wouldn't really matter since they couldn't take my hard earned minimum wage away from me. 



They called and emailed me a few times within the past year about stopping by to reactivate my account since they had officially opened. However, my family moved away from that area so I had no possibility of attending that gym. I notified them that I no longer live in the area then ignored their communication. 



So today, I've talked to the debt collector, and told them I would dispute the charges. I can only assume that my membership was never cancelled and I am still paying a monthly fee for the services I never used. (I never used the gym after the summer of 2013).



Here are some potentially relevant facts:



- The debit card that I paid with was a not associated with my bank account. It literally said ""insert name here"". It was a temporary debit card issued by my then employer. 



- The debt collector got my previous home address incorrect. I don't know the exact details of what I put down on the registration form, but apparently I gave them the wrong address. 



- I don't know how much they know about me. I don't remember if I provided a social security # or any other form of identification (drivers license?). And I have since discarded my copy of the contract. 



Where do I go from here? I read up online some of the rights that I have, such as receiving a verification of the debt, but I didn't want to update the debt collector on my current address since I'm hoping that I can somehow dispute the whole charge and would like to keep myself as anonymous as possible. $1500 may not sound like much, but to a broke college student, it is a very daunting amount. 



I may be a little wiser with my money than I was 2 years ago, but I still have no idea what to do and how to approach this problem. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3x4djc/debt_collection_for_a_service_provided_2_years_ago/,1450296932
Advice on student loan debt. $140k; lawyer; high potential earning capacity.,"I need some advice from the pf community on handling student loan debt. I have approximately $140k in federal student loans to pay for law school (these are both subsidized and unsubsidized), but luckily no private loans or undergrad loans. 

I am pretty fresh out of law school, so I don't have much savings and no retirement. I have credit card debt from 3 years of living expenses while in school, and have a budget to have that paid off in 1-3 months. 

I currently make a upper-mid 5 figure salary, with potential to increase exponentially over the next 5-7 years. My first year out, I hardly made any money, thus no savings or retirement to speak of. I worked very hard to pay off credit cards (which are at 0% interest), and have a budget in place to save approx. 1500 month towards an emergency fund this coming year after all other expenses and spending money. 

My question in how to handle student loan debt that sits at about 7.5% interest. I am currently on IBR and making the minimum payment based on my income. My understanding is that the loans will be forgiven after 25 years, but I will pay interest on the forgiven amount. I looked into the new REPAYE, but am concerned with the tax/income implications if you are married (S.O. makes good salary that I don't want counted against me). 

Here is my question, do I focus on building an emergency fund/savings/retirement now and make the minimum payments on my loans for the next 5 or so years until my salary increases, or try to pay off the loans now? I know the strategy is to pay off high interest debt first, but my current income just won't allow it. 

It doesn't help that the different repayment plans are insanely confusing to differentiate. I just don't want to be in a position where I will not be able to get married/buy a home/etc. for 15 years, but I also don't want to be in a position where I will be making $250k in ten years and pay $5k a month in student loans.

So when I was 18 (about a year ago) I went into the bank to make a payment or cash a cheque or something. When I was talking to the teller, she asked if I would like to open up a credit card.

School costs aside, because I am not sure if I am going to keep going to classes now, what would a budget look like with $1900 per month? Housing, food, etc ?

My company has been seriously underpaying me for years.,"Hey guys,
Thanks for your advice on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3qsxf4/10_years_at_same_company_5_with_no_raise/)!
I gave my boss a counter offer to his offer, and it's taken him weeks to discuss and finally agree to meet tomorrow.

In the mean time, I've learned some distressing things.  I've learned that even though I've been at the company for 10 years, I'm still almost one of the lowest paid people there (pretty sure people hired in the last couple years are making about what I'm making now, and people who were hired around when I was are definitely making more, I'm almost certain).  I don't think the higher ups know I know this, though.

To clarify my previous post, the database I designed and have been managing for them is a Filemaker database, but augmented with tons of scripting (including AppleScript, System Events, Shell Scripting) that I know isn't something that a novice would be able to do.  I don't believe a lot of the heads of the company know exactly how much work went into it and how much they rely on it though.

So basically I'm feeling very frustrated and taken advantage of.  I feel like my counter offer wasn't even high enough.  I'm feeling like I'm going to go into this meeting tomorrow angry.

Do you guys have any words of advice?  Anything to keep in mind when meeting tomorrow?  

Thanks again.

"buying a home, have great credit score, feel like it isn't helping me","Hello!  My income is $42,000 + bonuses. I am a sole man, no dependents, no prior marriage.  No military service.  Not disabled.  Just a normal single guy who lurks reddit. 

I am getting a HUD home - it's 127,000 with HUD agreeing to pay $2,000 in closing cost.  I put down that I'd do about 5% in down payment, but my parents said they would be willing to help with a gift to do more if I wanted.  My credit score came back at 805.  Because it's a HUD home, I don't qualify for any first time buyer benefits because I have to get a Conventional loan, and i don't need a 203k rehad, and FHA wont work for this.  I've already had my inspection and the lenders appraisal - home just needs a little bit of the roof repaired which is estimated at $450 for the repair that I need to put into escrow for repair after closing, but once that's done then the appraisal will place it at $138,000.  

What I'm being offered by the lender is todays rate of 4.25% for 30-year conventional, with agreements that I will buy a new water heater and appliances (home has none) prior to closing, and have them installed a week after closing - that's what the underwriter agreed to allow this loan.  

What kills me is they will not offer me anything better simply because I can't put more than 5% down.  

If someone with a 580 credit score did everything I did so far, and only had 5% down, they would get the same 4.25% deal I'm getting, and that sucks

Besides buying points to lower the rate, is there anything else I can do?  I have tried several times to negotiate lower prepaids and closing costs but they wont even budge - saying the new TRIPP rules and regulations prevent a lot of that from being negotiable...

What they've explained to me is that if I wanted to get anything lower than 4.25% without paying for points, I'd have to do a 25% down payment...that seems like crazy bullshit to me

I have jumped through every hoop well before the time required, signed and been prompt for everything they've asked from me.  Gone out of my way and done the things the way they want and let them choose who they want to do it.

Any advice to get a better deal that involves flexing my credit score would be helpful.  Thank you",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wfxzy/buying_a_home_have_great_credit_score_feel_like/,1449875676
"Desperation; a tale of employment, housing, and college.","Hello PF,

Yes, this is another one of those 'this is my situation, what do I do' posts. I simply cannot find/learn/think of a way to work this out. After taking a year off from schooling I am currently enrolled for the 2016 spring semester, taking 12 credits. I have 2 jobs, both of which are part time work at restaurants. I work a total of 32 or so hours a week. I make $10/hr and one, and tips at the other. Also, my total hours change each week based on the work that needs to be done. This leaves me with a monthly income somewhere in the range of 1200 dollars.

Now that I am taking a (kind of) full time schedule at college, I will need to drop 1day/week from my work. I'm calculating that my monthly income will fluctuate from $800-$1000. I've also calculated that my barebone expenses, not including housing, total about $400-$500 a month. 
Here comes the problem- Housing.
On-Campus housing is not an option as I am a transfer student and on-campus housing is in high demand. I've been looking into local apartments and I cannot find anything for less than $500/month, and those apartments do not include utilities/laundry/parking. So I figure I will need ballpark $600/month for housing.

So this leaves me with $-100/month, and that is if I do not buy books/clothes/fast food/vacation, etc.
How do I make up for this gap in income? I feel like the answer is right in front of me but my mind is too cluttered with other things to see it.

I think my company is contributing 7.5% after all is said and done. Is my math right?,"I'm currently contributing 6% of my pay toward my 401k, which means $4300 per year.  My company offers the following benefit:

&gt; an employer match of $0.50 for each $1 you contribute in regular contributions up to a maximum (2.5%) plus automatic employer contribution of 5% of eligible pay

So, if I understand correctly, my company will contribute $3500 automatically (I make 70k per year) plus match up to 2.5% of my own contribution at a 1-for-2 rate.  Since I'm saving 6% of my income I'm reaching the 2.5% match maximum, meaning my total savings annually is:

* $4300 of my own savings
* $3500 company automatic contribution
* $1750 company match (as long as I save at least 5%)

For a total annual contribution of $9550.  I'm pretty sure my math is correct; can anyone see any errors I've made?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wu3sn/i_think_my_company_is_contributing_75_after_all/,1450127770

"Questions about paying off student loan debt, federal student loan repayment, etc.","This question was sparked by the 'in-debt-dentist', but I think a different situation so bare with me...

I am an academic with 150K in debt, make about 110/yr (range 100-130 depending on whether I teach extra classes or get a bonus). I have been working for close to 5 years full time at a non-profit (university). I am banking on the federal student loan repayment program as I know many academics are! 

I am on a graduate repayment plan, paying under 500$/mnth (I could easily afford more, though). All of my loans are federal direct loans with interest rates between 2.07 and 2.9. 

Am I doing anything wrong here? 

If we make the assumption that the federal student loan repayment program is going to happen, I should just sit tight and keep doing what I am doing, right?

Help me avoid idiocy with an inheritance.,"I recently inherited a reasonable sum (a touch over 6 figures).  Married, 3 dependents, household income is just a hair under $200K.  I want to pay off a small amount of debt ($5K +/-) and perhaps take the family on a nice vacation.  I have a small IRA through the company I work for and have begun contributing more to take advantage of the match.

Survivorship life insurance,"So my mom is looking to get some life insurance. She's diabetic and doesn't qualify for her own so, apparently, our only options are AARP term, and survivorship. 

The term sounds like a crappy deal to me. It ends at 75 and it gets more expensive as you go, plus there's no info available about the death payout. Most of the people in my family live to their 90s despite having diabetes, that just makes it seem like even more of a waste. 

The thing I'm not understanding with survivorship, is how the pay out works. If one of us dies in 20 years, can the other cash out the policy and take both the dividends earned and the death benefit? Is it one policy or two bundled together? If I die, can my mom cash out mine and continue hers? If I'm insured for 150k and she's insured for 250k, and she dies, does the policy payout on the both amounts or just the 250k? 

This is all really confusing and I haven't been able to confirm some of the stuff the insurance guy has told me with other sources. Thanks!  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/3wxt35/survivorship_life_insurance/,1450187530
Just getting started on financial responsibility. Am I on the right track?,"I'm in my early 30's, married with two kids, single income. I've never really taken charge of my finances and I've always lived paycheck to paycheck. Last weekend I sat down and had a hard look at finances and accepted that I cannot continue to live this way. I grabbed YNAB, set up a clear budget to follow, and realized that my money is going to a lot of stupid things. My wife and I are dead set on getting out of debt and turning things around.

My main questions are around debt. Here's what I owe:

* Credit card $9.2k @ 9.9%
* Student loan one $8.5k @6.9%
* Student loan two $8.0k @5.0%
* Car loan $13.5k @ 0.0% (well in the black, not going to change this one)
* Mortgage $160k @ 3.79%

Assets are:

* $80k in traditional 401k
* $1k in a Roth IRA that hasn't been touched in about 7 years.
* Zero cash (paycheck to paycheck and payday is tomorrow!)

Decision points:

1. I am currently contributing around 13k to my 401k (before a small employer match). Should I take care of some or all debt (except the car) before increasing this? Ideally I'd like to hit the 18k limit. My instinct is to pay off the credit card first, but prioritize this over other debt.

2. The small Roth account has been untouched for a long time and I'm seriously considering cashing it out and paying down the credit card. I know the standard advice is to never touch anything retirement related, but it's one more account to track and it's not earning a rate anywhere near what my credit card debt is burning. Thoughts?

3. My wife disagrees with me on paying down the credit card first. My 6.9% student loan debt is actually broken into three smaller loans, and she's viewing it from the ""snowball"" perspective and wants to see some quick wins (I think the smallest is only 2k or so). I see her point, and although the math sides with me, can anyone provide a good argument why I should side with her?

Thanks everyone :)

Edit: for anyone asking where the emergency fund is - I don't have one. I do plan on slowly building one, and I am working on that now.

Just moved to USA (NYC) and spent most of my savings in the process. Need advice on how to start building savings again.,"Hey all,

I just moved to NYC from Australia and am now on a work visa. In doing this I spent almost all my savings which is a bit scary. So now I need to start saving again. For Mainly:

1. Emergency Fund
2. Travel (I moved to NYC so I can more easily travel the northern hemisphere and North America)

I have a chase checking account where my salary gets deposited. 

I want to try and save around $200 a week (I get paid weekly) but eventually $250 pw. 

What's the best/easiest/convenient way to save? In Australia I had an online saver with a different bank than my main account. Higher interest but a bit of a pain. 

A lot of banks here have wire/transfer fees that make this seem not worth it (what's a cheap way to wire money esp between your own accounts?) 

I was thinking of opening just a chase saver to make it easier but the interest seems pretty low and they seem to have a lot of clauses around transfer limits etc. 

I'd also like to use this account as a temporary holding account for my rent too. So once a month I'd take rent money out to pay it. 

I have the mint app and am using it but am a novice. Are there other tools I should use?

Recently paid off my last debt and now I need to recovery my shitty 517 score.,"I received a call a year ago about a $2000.00 debt i owed to the CA for a medical bill i received a few months before that. I kept brushing them off saying i had the insurance to cover it and there must have been a mistake. this went on for a whole year and I stupidly didn't do much about it.

Finally after all of a sudden needing myself another car a few weeks ago, I realize my credit is in the dumps at a 517. It's the only thing on my credit, i had no cards, loans, or anything, just that 1 delinquent mark and 14 hard inquiries from when i went to the dealership and got denied. I can't be approved for anything, and I'm stuck in a shitty shitty car that i have no idea how much longer will last.

Lacking the wisdom to dispute this any further, i desperately try and just remove this by just paying a settlement of $1600.00. I was told it will take 30 days after the full payment for them to send in the request to remove the debt from my score.

Now as I'm waiting for that to go on, I got me a secured credit card with a 500 dollar limit. I make good stable money now, and paying this all off will be easy. Id like some help in figuring out how to strategize that as good as i can to improve my score.

So I'm attempting to clean up my credit and boost it up as high and as fast as I can so that I can get a vehicle. I'm very much hoping I came to the right place in receiving your wisdom and help.

*Some notes:*

* I prefer to have the money in her name, instead of keeping ear-marked money in my own brokerage account. Growing up, money management was important in my family and having ownership and management of money at a young age was very educational. 
* I have read through various account types and understand the basic tax implications of each account type.

Fraud gym membership,"I know this might be a little far fetched as I am in Utah, but after googling I saw that a lot of people have this problem. I got a phone call today from a company called Swift Financial- they apparently run a collections account for the gym in my area. (VASA Fitness, but it used to be Gold's Gym) Anyways, I had never had an account with this gym and a couple of months ago I had a charge for them on my bank account for $120.00, I disputed it as fraud and got my money back and a new card number. Today this man called me and when I was explaining that I had no idea why my name would be on this account and why they would have all of my information, he called me a ""Big, fat liar"" and told me ""I am just going to ding your credit and we will be done with this conversation."" I asked to speak to his supervisor, he stated that he was the director in the company and he was the highest up that I could go. I told him that I will be taking him to court because he refused to send me any information about the collection or the amount due and he also said that I can't take him to court because  the call was not recorded so I would have nothing to go off of, he then hung up on me and would send my call directly to voicemail? SO unprofessional and SO rude, I have never in my life heard of a collection company acting like that. 

My main concern is with my research online, people are saying that this company went into their bank accounts and took money out without their consent.
