Last March, we posted a [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fhrfqo/coronavirus_megathread_resources_discussion_and/) with tons of information about Coronavirus-related issues, and in September a [second megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) was posted with additional information on updates to payroll tax deferrals, student loan interest waiver, and unemployment. Given the ongoing nature of the pandemic and recent U.S. governmental actions, we are posting a third installment of this megathread. **Please keep in mind that politics and political discussions are still not allowed here.**

# Stimulus Payments (updated Feb 13, 2021)

If you have not received the first or second stimulus payments at this point and believe you are eligible, or are eligible for more than you have already received based on your 2020 tax return, you will have to file your 2020 tax return and claim the missing amount as the [Recovery Rebate Credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/recovery-rebate-credit). Common cases where this applies:

*I believe I was eligible for the first and second stimulus but haven't received it, and still get an error when checking the Get My Payment portal

* I was a dependent in 2019 (and/or 2018 if your 2019 was not yet filed for the first stimulus), or mistakenly indicated that I could be claimed as a dependent, but cannot be claimed as a dependent for 2020 (Note: You don't just decide if you're a dependent or not, verify if you are eligible to be claimed as one [as defined by the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p501#en_US_2019_publink1000196863).)

* I had a child in 2020 and am now eligible for the additional amount for a qualifying dependent

You can check if you are eligible with the [IRS eligibility FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-a-eip-eligibility). Non-dependent individuals were eligible for $1200 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus if your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) was below $75,000. For married couples filing jointly, it is $2,400 for the first stimulus and $1,200 for the second stimulus if your joint AGI is below $150,000. Taxpayers with dependent qualifying children will receive $500 for the first stimulus and $600 for the second stimulus per qualifying child (16 or younger, the rules are based on the child tax credit).

If your AGI is above the cutoff amounts noted above, your stimulus payment will be reduced by 5% of the difference between your AGI and the income threshold. For example, if you are single and without kids, the potential maximum amount is completely phased out once your income hits $99,000 for the first stimulus and $87,000 for the second stimulus. If you are married with two young children then the maximum payment is completely phased out once your joint income hits $218,000 for the first stimulus and $174,000 for the second stimulus.

**The recovery rebate credit is determined based on the information on your 2020 tax return**, you can see the amount you’re being credited directly on your Form 1040, Line 30 of your prepared return before you file. Any of the online tax services can handle this tax credit. If you have questions about which tax software to use, there is a [Tax Filing Software Megathread](https://old.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/kz613i/tax_filing_software_megathread_a_comprehensive/) with more information.

Some people have reported getting the second stimulus payment later than expected, so it’s recommended to double check the status of your stimulus payments on the [Get My Payment portal](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) before filing your tax return. 

### **FAQs:**

* **Q** I filed my 2020 tax return already to claim the second stimulus payment I hadn’t yet received, then received a check in the mail for the missing amount. What do I do?

* **A**  You'll likely have to wait until your return is processed, and then file an amended return, to correct this issue.

* **Q** I don’t file tax returns because I earn below the reporting threshold or don’t have any income. How do I get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A**  You can file a tax return without income. Include any income you do have, even if it is below the reporting threshold, even income from a savings account can be included. Otherwise you may need to add in $1 in interest income in order for the online tax services to be able to handle processing the return. This is essentially what the Non-Filer’s Tool that was open last year did for you.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. If I never received it, is there anything I can do to get the recovery rebate credit?

* **A** No, the recovery rebate credit is ultimately a 2020 tax credit. The information provided on your 2020 tax return is what is being used to determine your eligibility, your previous return information does not matter at this point.

* **Q** I am eligible for both the first and second and stimulus based on my 2018 and/or 2019 tax return, but will not be eligible based on my 2020 tax return. Will I need to pay back what I received?

* **A** No, there was no information provided in the bills requiring payments to be returned if eligibility changes between the 2018/2019 and 2020 tax years. This is also noted in the [IRS FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-j-reconciling-on-your-2020-tax-return).

* **Q** The [Get My Payment](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment) portal says the payment was already sent and/or I received Notice 1444 in the mail saying my stimulus was sent, however I never actually received it. What do I do?

* **A** See the IRS page on [Payment Issued but Lost, Stolen, Destroyed or Not Received](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payment-information-center-topic-f-payment-issued-but-lost-stolen-destroyed-or-not-received) for guidance on starting a Payment Trace

The IRS has an extensive list of [Economic Impact Payment FAQs](https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payment-information-center) with more information.

Be aware of potential scams related to stimulus payments or other coronavirus relief packages. CNBC has a helpful article with examples of [common stimulus scams](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/29/stimulus-check-scams-here-are-red-flags-to-watch-for.html).

At this time, [a third stimulus has been proposed](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/602024/second-stimulus-check-update-senate-kills-2000-payments), but has not been officially passed. If that changes we will update this information to reflect that. **Until then, there is no additional information to provide regarding the criteria for a potential third stimulus or how the payments may or may not be handled.**

# Payroll Tax Deferral

Payroll taxes consist of two related taxes: Social Security (6.2% of wages) and Medicare (1.45% of wages). Both employees and employers pay these taxes (i.e., for every $1 of social security taxes you pay, your employer also pays $1). Only the Social Security portion of payroll taxes may be deferred right now, not Medicare.

The Secretary of the Treasury has been [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-deferring-payroll-tax-obligations-light-ongoing-covid-19-disaster/) to defer the collection of Social Security taxes on those making a gross income of less than $104,000 / year ($4,000 or less per bi-weekly paycheck) starting September 1.

Implementing seems to be optional by employers and many employers have decided to not implement this.

The IRS had issued Notice 2020-65 indicating that taxes deferred must be withheld and paid between January 1, 2021 and April 30, 2021, or interest and penalties will start accruing on May 1, 2021. **The window to payback the deferred taxes has been extended under the new stimulus bill to December 31, 2021. Deferred taxes must be paid by January 1, 2022 or interest and penalties will start accruing.** 

See the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for FAQs regarding the payroll tax deferral 

# Coronavirus-Related Distributions from Retirement Plans

Penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts for Coronavirus-Related Distributions ended December 30, 2020. If you made one of these withdrawals during 2020, remember that you have three years to pay the income taxes on the withdrawal. The IRS has an article with [Coronavirus-related relief for retirement plans and IRAs questions and answers](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/coronavirus-related-relief-for-retirement-plans-and-iras-questions-and-answers) with more information.

# Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Rollover

FSA account balances typically do not rollover year-to-year. The second stimulus package allows for FSA balances at the end of 2020 to be rolled over and used in 2021. Any FSA balance remaining at the end of 2021 may also be rolled over and used in 2022.

# Unemployment Benefits

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) provides benefits to individuals typically not eligible for unemployment insurance, such as independent contractors or gig workers. Under the CARES Act these benefits were set to expire Dec 31, 2020. It has now been extended to March 14, 2021. Please visit your state’s PUA website for more information.

The previous unemployment relief of $300/week from the federal government and $100/week from the state expires Dec 26, 2020 (see the [previous megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/i8mww4/coronavirus_megathread_update_resources/) for more information and FAQs regarding [this executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/) from August). **Under this new bill, federal unemployment will provide an additional $300/week through March 14, 2021, and the maximum number of weeks that unemployment can be claimed has been increased from 39 weeks to 50 weeks.**

**If you lost your job or are at risk of losing your job:**

Please read the information available in the [Job Loss Megathread: unemployment resources, state-specific information, and help](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/fkyu8h/job_loss_megathread_unemployment_resources/)

If you have any questions regarding those resources, feel free to ask here, but please be as specific as possible with your current situation and what steps you have taken so far.

# Student Loan Interest and Payment Waiver (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The CARES Act suspended federally-held student loan payments and interest charges until September 30, 2020. The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/) signed in August extended this to December 31, 2020. The December bill extended this date to January 31, 2021. At the [end of January](https://myfedloan.org/borrowers/covid/f), the deferment was extended until Sept 30, 2021. 

Key points:

- Private student loans are not affected.
- [If your loan is federally-held, you do not need to take any action to suspend payments. Your federal student loan servicer will suspend all payments automatically. You do not need to contact your student loan servicer.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-student-loans-and-coronavirus-pandemic/)
- If your loan is *not* federally-held (i.e., federal student loans held by commercial lenders), do not assume you can pause payments without contacting your servicer. You may want to look into income-driven payment plans.

# Stock market turbulence

It's very natural to be feel concerned when there's a large drop in the stock market, especially after such a long period of growth, but it's important to keep perspective and avoid making rash decisions.

First, take a deep breath. Market downturns are not uncommon or unusual. [Between 1980 and 2017, there were **11 market corrections and 8 bear markets**.](https://institutional.vanguard.com/VGApp/iip/site/institutional/researchcommentary/article/NewsPerspectiveMktDownturns)

[Trying to time the market rarely turns out well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unFn-ddtqiM&t=4) and most people trying to enter or exit the market based on emotion, gut feelings, and everyone's predictions end up doing far worse than if they had simply continued business as normal. **[Stick to your plan and stay the course.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/2jbtyu/investment_pro_tip_stay_the_course/)**

To quote Warren Buffett: **[""to buy or sell on current news is just crazy""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaXmmaEs-hU&t=24)**.

Don't make an emotional decision, don't try to predict where the market is headed in the short run, and make decisions for the long run. You're investing for decades, not trying to predict the Dow Jones or S&P 500 next week, next month, or even next year.

# Being financially prepared and practicing sound finances

1. [Budget your money and reduce expenses.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_0.3A_budget_and_reduce_expenses.2C_set_realistic_goals) Fundamental to a sound financial footing is knowing where your money is going. Budgeting helps you see your sources of income less your expenses. You should minimize your expenses to the extent practical.

2. [Build an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics#wiki_step_1.3A_build_an_emergency_fund) An emergency fund should be a relatively liquid sum of money that you don't touch unless something unexpected comes up. For most people, 3 to 6 months of expenses is good. A larger emergency fund may be warranted if your income is variable or uncertain. If you're in credit card debt, aim for one month of expenses and focus the rest of your money on paying down debt.

3. Don't check out of your finances. Continue following the steps in [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) as best possible starting at the beginning of the flowchart. If you can't make rent, contact your landlord. If you have trouble paying your mortgage, see below. If there are bills you can't pay, research your options and contact the company. Simply not paying a bill without any communication is almost certainly not your best option.

4. There's more good stuff you should be doing in this [video from Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:_Start_with_a_Sound_Financial_Lifestyle) and the [PF wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index).

# Most mortgage owners eligible for reduced or suspended payments for up to 12 months under the CARES Act 

Key points:

1. The CARES Act covers about [70% of all mortgages](https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=406472) in the U.S. (those backed by Fannie and Freddie, FHA, VA, or USDA). Many companies have similar policies for most other types of loans. If you aren't sure what kind of loan you have, ask your servicer.

2. In most cases, you will [not owe the missed payments as lump sum](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/after-you-receive-relief/#repay). There was a lot of confusion about this. The new guidance says that lump sums are not required for [GSE](https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Announces-Payment-Deferral-as-New-Repayment-Option-for-Homeowners-in-COVID-19-Forbearance-Plans.aspx) and [federal loans](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/SFH/documents/IACOVID19FBFactSheetConsumer.pdf).

3. You can't just stop paying your mortgage. Contact your servicer to find out if you are eligible for this or if your servicer has adopted a similar policy.

4. Requesting mortgage relief/deferral will appear on your credit reports and may affect your eligibility for refinancing (but doesn't affect your actual credit score).

5. For more info, the CFPB published [step-by-step information](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/housing) about how to request payment relief.

# Refinancing

[If you're in the market for refinancing your mortgage, it may be worth considering](https://clark.com/homes-real-estate/when-should-i-refinance-mortgage-2020/), but if you don't have a healthy emergency fund and extra cash, you may not want to refinance right now due to the up-front costs. 

Effective Dec 1, 2020, refinancing mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will incur a 0.5% [adverse mortgage fee](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/refinancing-a-mortgage-will-cost-more-thanks-to-an-adverse-market-fee.html). 

# Relief for Renters (updated Feb 13, 2021)

The [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-fighting-spread-covid-19-providing-assistance-renters-homeowners/) signed in August required certain federal agencies to take steps to limit foreclosures or evictions. It did not include a list of specific actions or policies. 

Following this in September, the CDC ordered [Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions To Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/04/2020-19654/temporary-halt-in-residential-evictions-to-prevent-the-further-spread-of-covid-19) that expires December 31, 2020. This has since been extended to March 31, 2021.

Read [Protection for Renters](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/coronavirus/mortgage-and-housing-assistance/renter-protections/) from the CFPB and visit the [NLIHC page for COVID-19 Rental Assistance programs](https://nlihc.org/rental-assistance) for additional information and resources

I would then do a year of community college over there since the cost of living/ college would still be significantly cheaper than going to a full 4-year college and at that point, I would qualify for in-state tuition which is 3x cheaper than the cost of out of state tuition. Then finally I'd transfer to a 4 yr university and finish out my last 2 years there. I would end up paying a total of $26,000 instead (which is still costly) instead of $146,460.

Also someone once said When they ask you what your range is to not answer right away and just tell them you are sure they pay competitive wages and then ask more about the company or the job. That doesn’t seem like a good way though?? Do I just tell them right away or stall? And do I say a range or certain number?

There is a way around this by getting a limited questionnaire vs the full questionnaire, and avoiding the appraisal. But that's tricky and a hassle, and would deter would-be buyers.

I am worried about trying to resell later and the buyer getting a loan, because the buyer will also face getting a loan with the 25% rule.

11,Loan Officer trying to change our interest rate after we signed off on the 'locked in' rate,"Hello all-

We are about two weeks into closing. We signed off on everything including our rate of 3.25 (no points). Today she called me and told me that underwriting found out the underestimated our income and we don't qualify for the program she had us under that gave us 3.25, and our rate would not be 3.5, unless we wanted to to pay for points. She said it was 'her mistake' and 'my bad' multiple times. I told her she needed to match what she originally told us and what we signed off for at 3.25. She said she would ask but at the most they MIGHT do is 3.375, and told us 'its just the cost of going out to dinner a month, it doesn't make much of a difference'. If she messed up, can't her company eat the cost? She made a mistake, admitted to it, and now I'm paying more? I spoke with my real estate agent and she said we can switch lenders, I'm going to talk with my credit union tomorrow. Are we screwed, or can we hold her to the 3.25 that was on the paperwork we signed?

Eta:

-Our income did not change, the loan officer apparently messed up her numbers somewhere along the line and underwriting caught it.

-This if for a conventional loan

-We are planning on talking to some other banks to see if they can do better then the new rate she is offering us.

-The changes she talked to me about were all over phone, nothing documented as of yet. 

-This is the second time she has changed the rate, it was originally 2.875 when we were looking at houses, two weeks later it was 3.25 because rates were going up which sucked but I understood. She asked if we wanted to float or lock in 3.25, we locked it in and signed everything, and it was sent to underwriting.

12,At what rate is collision insurance worth it for a 2007 car with ~130k miles?,"I drive a modest old car that is in really good shape and has never given me any problems. Bought it used from the only previous owner, for 70-75%  of what it's worth in my area, pretty good deal. I don't use it much, only a few times a week for short local errands. It rarely goes on the highway and I do not depend on my car to get to work. 

Now, mi insurance is insanely high because despite the fact that I've been driving for over two decades and I have never gotten into a serious accident, I cannot prove it (foreign license) so I got the highest prime as an inexperienced driver. The only two accidents that I've had were rear-ends that were not my fault at all and the last one was over 10 years ago. 

Since my prime is so high already (a significant % of my car's value) I only got the most basic insurance, and not collision. It made sense to me and just assumed that if I get into an accident not payed by another's insurance, I'll just suck it up and pay for the repairs knowing that if my car is totaled I'll have to get another similar one out of pocket (I can do that). I was pretty comfortable with this decision but lately several people have told me it's a terrible idea and that I should add collision to my insurance. 

So my question is: Is there a % of the car's market value at which it makes sense to add or not add collision to my insurance? Or, am I totally insane and I should add it at any rate (why?)?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m17n1i/at_what_rate_is_collision_insurance_worth_it_for/,1615300506.0,17,17,0
13,Is paying mortgage down early too good to be true? Should that money be invested elsewhere?,"I crunched some numbers in a Mortgage Calculator..

If made an extra monthly payment of $469.26 the mortgage would be payed off in 171 months. This equates to an extra $80,243.46 being applied over the course of the loan. Interest paid would be $58,210. In this scenario I effectively cut the interest payed under normal circumstances from $121,372 in half...

Applying the same $80,243.46 in one lump sum this month means the mortgage would be payed off in 25 months.. leaving interest paid at only $5,540. This squashes that $63162 savings even lower to only $5,540!

I filed taxes for 2014 and 2015 while still in high school, but since I graduated my life has been one fiasco after another. I've had so many odd jobs that I'm not even sure I could correctly list them all or even what towns they were in. I'll spare you the details and excuses, but the point is I haven't filed taxes in years. I finally screwed my head on right last year - even kept the same job through the year - and truly want to make things right with the IRS too, but I've only managed to hold onto five W2s over the past four years and I'm fairly sure there are at least twice as many out there somewhere (yet none that earned over $1k apiece).

But is that really the best way for me to handle this? If there are such services, I have a few hundred dollars that I could use to pay someone like a tax consultant to track down my W2s via my social security number.

I authorized a purchase on Airbnb for \~$1,800 using my Paypal account as a form of payment which is already associated with my Airbnb account. After selecting that form of payment, the user interface of Airbnb never asks which bank account from my Paypal that should be used. However I wasn't worried about this because I know my credit card is the preferred payment method on Paypal. Airbnb completed the transaction and everything seemed fine. 

The next day I noticed a $35 returned item fee on my checking account because Paypal tried to charge my checking account $1,800, which that account didn't have. For some reason, Paypal used my checking account instead of my ""preferred"" method of the credit card. I called Paypal, and they said it's because Airbnb is a “subscription” merchant on my account, so the payment method was automated to my checking account despite me never setting it as such.

The worst part is, when I called Paypal to tell them what happened and to stop trying to charge my checking account, they said that they couldn’t. So I may end up with another fee when they try to withdrawl again. I’ve already called my bank, and they suggested I dispute the payment if a second withdrawl is attempted. How shitty is it that Paypal has no resolution for this mistake other than making a stop payment from my bank?

Anybody have a similar situation with better advise to resolve? I am deleting Paypal as soon as this is cleared.

My tip to anyone reading – go into your Paypal account and delete the “subscription” merchants you don’t regularly make payments to, and of the ones you want to keep, ensure the right form of payment is saved. Paypal has such shitty user interface and customer service so if you make the same mistake I did, you could end up over drafting.

Now, I don't know what rate I will get from the lenders, the ""ideal"" situation would be the developer's lender gives me the lowest rate AND i get credit so I don't need to think twice. But, one of my lenders did say I could refinance to get a potentially lower market rate after I sign with the developer's lender (and reap the lender credit benefit) since the lenders for developers don't necessarily give best rates. I did to a little research on points and lender credit and how lender credit is reverse points and that could mean i get a higher rate at cost of getting $$$.

I have a couple of questions:

1. Is it OK to ask the developer about refinancing? I don't know if they care if i sign with them and then couple months later refinance. I am also concerned about potential penalties or return of closing costs. If asking them will alert them then i rather not.
2. Is this strategy legit? It does sound fine - get the lender credits then refinance at lower rate. Naturally it has to make financial sense on the refinance as well.
3. Does it make sense to ""shop around"" lenders? I only kept in touch with 2 lenders for pre-approvals. One lender gave me a higher pre-approval rate than the other. Should I reach out to that just as due diligence?

43,I know nothing about taxes.,"I've tried to understand the basic concepts of taxes, but no luck. I've also read about it on every website I could possibly find, still no idea. I am completely new to taxes, and I appreciate any answers given to my questions. Here are my questions regarding taxes:

1- What is the payment method used to pay taxes (e.g. credit card, debit card, etc.) and where do you pay them?

2- Is filling the IRS tax form the only thing required for taxes, or do you have to follow additional steps?

3- If you start working on December and earn money by January, do you have to file taxes for that year? Example: If I worked on December 2020 and earned $1000 by January 2021, do I have to file taxes on April for 2020?

4- If the soonest you can file your taxes is January, and the deadline is on April, does it mean we can't file taxes between May and December?

5- What are all the legal documents required to file taxes or give to a tax accountant?

6- Does your income count in January through April, towards your taxes?

7- What do you do with the IRS tax form once you completed it?

8- How do you know how much you owe the IRS?

9- (similar to question 4) If you start working in February or April, do you have to pay taxes by the deadline?

10- How do you pay your taxes if you move out of state, and you still owe taxes to your previous state?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m1endm/i_know_nothing_about_taxes/,1615319511.0,2,2,0

We have money we put into retirement accounts each month and aren’t touching that. We also have cash in savings for emergency use, and don’t really want to touch much, if any, of that. I looked into a HELOC at current rate of 3.25%, but it was interest only and ballooned at 10yrs. So I’d have to pay near $1,000/mo to pay off that $50k loan in that time-not doable. We have no credit card debt, but have a student loan and vehicle payment that will be finished in a couple years.

Looking at cash out refi, and trying to keep monthly payment lower so it doesn’t disrupt our savings plans etc, but rates keep ticking up higher past our current 3.25%... plus add closing costs. 

We originally were thinking of keeping our same 22yr term, but we can get a bit of a rate break by doing a 20yr term. Only prob is that jumps the payment up quite a bit. Was actually thinking of going out to a 25yr to help with lowering payment. Also not sure if we should use equity or cash to buy more points to lower the rate.

51,"Previous Landlord sent bill for Carpet to Collections without notification, additionally I have a dispute with the bill itself."," 

Hello /r/personalfinance

Today one of my old roommates received notice from a collections agency that we owed 1547.XX for carpet damage and replacement in our previous dwelling. In calling our old apartment complex he was told the following:

1. They no longer have any information on the matter aside from the bill (which they've sent us).
2. The bill contains one charge for carpeting for the aforementioned value, with a prepared by date of two months before we moved out, and a printed date of 5 days post moveout.
3. The bill was not sent to my roommates provided forwarding address (new apt), but to the address of his parents, which is what was provided when he signed the lease.

This all seemed pretty skeezy, and this being my first time hearing of it, I re-asked the above and received similar answers (except that they'd only sent this bill to him, and not the other two of us on the lease).

We contacted the debt collection agency who sent the notice, and they provided pictures of the carpet (which do not show any damage that exceeds normal wear and tear) and a walkout checklist which only notes ""matting"" in the two locations. Additionally, they provided us with a document we signed when we originally moved in, which states : ""Normal wear and tear is to be expected... and that the carpet was replaced the week before we moved in, and the total cost of carpet replacement is 1477.xx, and that there is a lifespan of 5 years, meaning they could only charge for the remaining 4 years of use, accounting for 1181.XX.

I'd like to dispute the entire sum on the following basis:

1. The "" heavy traffic matting"" referenced in the bill represents ""normal wear and tear.""
2. Even if someone was completely blind, and determined it was beyond, ""normal wear and tear"" then the sections of carpet deemed ""matted"" and requiring replacement was far smaller than the amount replaced, and we should only be responsible for the portion of carpet which they considered ""damaged beyond repair""
3. That even if someone was not only completely blind, but they also were experiencing severe mental handicaps, and determined the entire carpet of the apartment needed replacement, that the only allowable portion of the debt based off of the previous documentation is the 1181.xx.

How should I approach this?

Additionally, the pictures of the ""damage"" are dated 6 days after the letter was ""printed"", and 9 days after the initial inspection. See the ""damage"" attached : [https://imgur.com/a/qsVYx48](https://imgur.com/a/qsVYx48)

53,What is a reasonable estimate of up front costs for buying a house in 2021?,"Hi all, sorry for the incoming wall of text. 

I’m saving up to buy my first home and thought I was getting close to having enough, but after more research am really concerned I’m only halfway there. I’m looking to spend in the 200K range. I have 28K saved. I was hoping to use 20K for a 10% down payment and have 5K for closing costs. Then a safety set of 3K in savings. 

Here’s the main issue:

I’m in Pennsylvania and the estimates I’m getting online are giving me insane closing costs, as well as estimates for back taxes on the property — wouldn’t the current owner of the home be paying property taxes in their mortgage before I buy it? Should I plan to be responsible for all the property tax accrued before I close? 

Between back taxes and closing costs combined, I’m getting an estimate of over $13K, and that’s not even touching a down payment. Is this normal? 

Can anyone who has recently bought a house give me a breakdown of what they paid upfront and what my options may be when it comes to paying back taxes or minimizing other fees?

Thanks for all your feedback and sorry in advance for not being well versed in this!

EDIT: I realized saying back taxes is misrepresenting the problem. When I apply for estimates for loan rates and closing costs, I’m running into an estimate that includes three months of state and local property taxes that would be collected at the time of closing.

55,Emergency Fund Philosophy,"Hi everyone, 

This is something that occurred to me today as I was doing some budget upkeep for my family that after well over a decade of stringent budgeting and emergency fund maintenance I've never considered before. 

I use YNAB and have many different savings categories; new car, big vacation, upcoming education expenses, car repair, home maintenance, and finally our emergency fund. This isn't the full list but these are the big ones. We also have an HSA account that is quite healthy, and medical insurance with 0% coinsurance after our deductible is hit, I keep at least the full deductible in our HSA but last year we hardly needed any doctor visits and now we have two years of deductibles saved. 

What popped into my head today is that I feel like we have a lot of broken out savings funds that are normally accounted for in a family's emergency fund, and I wonder if I am (sounds funny to say) keeping too much cash, and not investing enough. We contribute our goal amounts to our retirement and investment accounts, and look to be on track to meet our retirement goals, but because of all the savings funds we maintain generally we're looking at roughly 20-25% of our portfolio being cash which is very, very high. 

If I were to lose my job, or be hurt and unable to work for a while (I do have LT and ST disability insurance too), obviously things like new cars and vacations would be deprioritized quickly, and we'd be using that money towards our emergency spending. With that being the case, I think our emergency fund is almost 10 months of expenses, but is that the right way to think about it? Should we target a smaller emergency fund among all the other savings we maintain, and lower our cash allocation a big to boost our investing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m1d5z6/emergency_fund_philosophy/,1615315554.0,2,2,0

64,Some questions about married taxes,"Hi all, thanks for responding to my last question about what type of service I should be looking for to answer a general tax questions. A couple people suggested asking this sub, so here it goes.

My spouse and I divide out our finances because we have different assets, he has debt, different lifestyles, and beliefs about money. Combining our finances together doesn't work and every tax season we go through very nasty fights. Currently, our tax status is married filing jointly with no allowances. I am a W-4 employee and my spouse works various jobs so his employment is all over the place.

In the past, we have been doing married filing together and my spouse puts in all of his stuff, and then I write down his numbers as this is what he owes or will get back, and then I put in all of my stuff and those are the final numbers and I pick up the pieces. I understand that this is a complete bullshit way of doing things. This year it has really bitten me in the ass and I am struggling to figure out how to divide things, and exactly what that means. Another part of the dilemma is that my spouse thinks that he has put in a lot extra for taxes and I am just not seeing it. And the last part of the question is since I am a W-4 employee and have no allowances taken out, how the heck are we owing so much - I thought that W4 taxes that are taken out by your company should be right on par.

This year I also crunched the numbers about what it would mean for each of us if we change to married filing separately.

Here are our numbers (approximates for privacy):

Married filling jointly tax forms with only spouse things entered:

- fed refund: 3,000
- state refund: 1,300

Our married filing jointly with both people entered:

- fed owe 2,500
- state refund 1,800

 I also calculated out what our taxes would be like if we each filed married filing separately

Spouse married filling sep: fed owe 700, state refund 700

Me married filling sep: fed owe 1700,  state refund 1200

So my questions are

1 - since I am a W-4 employee with no exceptions, why am I owing so much money every year in Federal? I thought that my company was supposed to tax at the correct rate. Is it because I am married to my spouse and our combined income brings up our taxable rate?

2 - given that my spouse owed some money when he changed from married filing jointly two married filing separately, does that mean that he really did not save that much money for taxes? He really thinks that he outdid himself and was expecting several thousands of dollars and got excited when he saw his stuff in the married filing jointly without mine entered, but I can see some jobs where he did not put in any taxes and tried to tax himself extra on other jobs to ""make up for"" it but I just didn't really see that extra, so I sort of think that his standing is sort of b*******. What's your take?

3 - regarding the previous question, is it possible that he thinks he is putting in so much money because he is calculating his taxable rate as a single person instead of the income we make jointly? Or is the way that he is doing things just nonsensical. Basically, what did he do that was wrong, and how can we fix it next time?

4 - please help us save our marriage. We do not know how to divide up our finances between us. How can we figure out who actually owes what? 

I calculated out the rates if we both filed as married filing single, and I tried to break down our final married filing jointly numbers as percentages according to the married filing single results but he rejected those and said that they were b*******.

I finally got into contact with the CA tax board (they don’t make it easy), but they could only answer general questions about tax filing and mentioned a dependent can’t make more than 4K a year. 

I’m confused because I’ve seen on different forums that Social Security income is exempt as long as it’s under 21k for a single person, but I’ve also heard it isn’t. Clarification would be helpful as I decide my next move or just accept the results.

I called them to try to fight it, but since my account was already waved $35 two times, they couldn’t do anything about it.

The builder has $5000 bonus for upgrade ""options"" but is not giving much options other than gutters and a garage door opener for $2000 and the other $3000 going towards the house.

Fiance and I toured this place three days ago and told our agent we are interested in it since it is 4/2.5 and 2000sq ft at a reasonable price. We found a list of the options they allowed and told our real estate agent we want a ceiling fan on the patio and pre-wired option for the extra bedrooms since only the family room and master bedroom come with ceiling fans (in Texas mind you.)

She said the builder said he cannot run wires since the walls and drywalls are up. I am pretty sure that's bullshit but ok, we don't really need it with central A/C. Our rental house as of now has gutters, garage door opener, two patio ceiling fans, under cabinet lights, linen cabinet and bullnose corners.. These are all upgrade options for the builder but he is only willing to do the gutters and garage door opener since the house will be finished in two months.

Not sure why he’s saying any other upgrades can’t be done in a two month time frame, especially when baseboards, cabinets, toilets or lights aren’t installed yet. Kind of weird he’s getting uptight about us deciding what options to get for a house we’ll be living in for a decade or two.

 Currently, I pay 412.76 every month at an interest rate of around 11% or 12%. The personal loan would be from the place I bank with because I got promotional mail from them saying I could get around 5.74% apr on a 10k loan. Currently, I have $6,805(USD) in my bank account and was thinking of using the combined $16,805.53(USD) to pay off the car, leaving me with around 3k in the bank. 

This loan would drop my monthly payments from $412.76 to $304 at the advertised 5.74%. I make around 2k a month with income, and my expenses aren't that big; most of my money goes to rent, car payments, and insurance. I'm also a full-time student who works part-time. (work around 30-35 hours)

That changed when I signed up for doordash and started putting in hours. Yes my income has dramatically increased but gas costs and such have. This has lead to a credit usage increase which dinged me a few points. Wanting to save on these new found expenses, about 3 months ago I asked for my card to be upgraded to one that received cash back. Upgrading avoided applying for a new card, but my limit is still 500. 

I don’t want to ask for a credit limit increase because it might backfire. I’ve been told the limit is based on annual income and since my job is relatively new, they don’t “see it” as income I have currently. 

An option would be to apply for a second credit card so I can manage credit usage better but applying would ding credit and I might run into the income problem there too. 

Should I just hold for right now? (The goal is to build credit first and foremost when my expenses are low and I can manage debt)

I am refinancing with the same company I originally got my loan with in New York. I own a condo and have made payments on it for a year but the rates now are much better. 

Current loan is 297,000 on 3.99 interest fixed 30 years. 

New loan would be 305,000 on a 2.5 interested fixed 15 years. 

Now my question is this. When looking at the fees breakdown it says

0.33% of loan amount (points)- 996.60. 

And then at the bottom it says 
Lender credits (includes $2560.14 credit for increasing closing costs above legal limit)- $2560.14

I did some research and it seems lender credits negatively impact your interest rate. When I questioned my loan person about he says the credits are for “covering the appraisal, processing,underwriting and other fees” which he says that company offers for using them again. 

He states that it did not impact my interest rate. Is that true? I didn’t ask for lender credits does anyone know more about it? And last question can anyone explain why it says that the credit is for increasing my closing costs above legal limit?

89,Would you risk an interest rate spike for a new construction you love? Need advice with budget provided.,"tl;dr: Question in the post title. Here's some context:

My husband and I have been searching for a home. We live in central Virginia in a competitive market, where homes are gone before you can even get a response from a realtor. We've inquired about a new townhome construction that we really like in a great area. Due to demand, we can't contract until May 1. Price increases between now and then would put the townhouse at \~$340,000. At contract signing we'd have to put down 5%, which we would lose if we back out between contract signing and actual closing (estimated to be Fall 2021). We can't rate lock until closer to construction being complete.

My father will be paying the down payment somewhere in the range of $70,000-100,000. He would be the one purchasing the property, so it would be a second home mortgage with slightly higher rates, with an 830 credit score. My husband and I will be paying the mortgage itself. Here's a breakdown of my husband and I's monthly approximate income/expenses outside of housing:

* Income after taxes/health insurance/401k for me: $4,800
* Food: $800 (we eat out a lot and would definitely cut back)
* Car Insurance: $80
* Gas: $160
* Phone: $150
* Pets: $200 (prescription food for cat, food for dog, extra set aside for future vet bills)
* Misc.: $200 (toiletries, household supplies, etc.)
* Net: $3,210

I think we could comfortably afford \~$2,000 in PITI+HOA, to leave us with \~$1,200 for utilities and additional savings or expenditures (we're looking to have our first child in a few years, so that's a consideration too). Playing with mortgage calculators, assuming $100k down, property taxes, HOA of $120/month, and estimate insurance , rates could spike up to 7% and we'd still be ok. But what if they're higher?

We're otherwise frugal people. We don't go out to bars, go shopping, etc. We're homebodies that play video games and watch Netflix. We have $13k emergency fund. Our jobs are stable with skillsets that can be easily transferred. What would you all do in this scenario? The townhome is 1,900sqft, 3bed, 2 full bath, 2 half bath, two car garage, lots of room to grow a family in a great neighborhood. It checks all the boxes, but I don't want to push this decision and end up house poor.

\-------------------------------------------

**Background Information:**

* I'm a graphic designer based in **Virginia** 
* **2019:** I worked as a 1099 contractor before leaving my job in July and getting a new position as a full time employee in October 2019. My **2019 Gross Income was $37,563**, and my **Total Taxable Income was $18,901** 
* **2020:** In May I was laid off because of COVID and have since been working as a freelancer to earn some additional income. I am not sure what my exact 2020 taxable income is yet but my **2020 gross income looks like it's going to be around $22,000** (plus **\~$5,500 in unemployment**, but I'm under the impression that my unemployment payments aren't taxed in VA. Let me know if this is incorrect). 
* My filing status is **single** for both years (2019 and 2020)
* It's been a while since I went through the unemployment application process but if I remember correctly, I didn't qualify for regular unemployment because the bulk of my 2019 income was from my 1099 contracting job. So I've been receiving **PUA unemployment benefits** since May 2020. 

\-------------------------------------------

**Questions:**

1. **When I file my 2020 taxes, will my unemployment benefits be decreased?** I am not sure how unemployment is calculated but I'm under the impression it's based on your most recent tax filing. Since I've made roughly 50% less this year, will I receive less in unemployment? 
2. Follow up question is; **is it possible to file an extension on my 2020 taxes until I am employed again, so that I continue to receive the maximum unemployment benefits?** I'm talking about paying my 2020 taxes on time but not actually filing the paperwork until I get a job and no longer need the unemployment benefits. I feel like I've discovered a suspiciously convenient loophole, which makes me think I'm missing something. 
3. Bonus question, if anyone knows: **will I continue to file for PUA or will I need to switch to regular unemployment**, since my 2020 taxes will reflect that I was employed full time for the first half of the year?

I am trying to refinance with my mom as she can no longer afford payments much longer. Part of the deal is that I will receive the house + property eventually and this is something I want. She currently has a 4.625% rate and with me cosigning we should be able to bring that down to the 3% range. Hopefully rates remain low for the next couple months.

My mom was able to buy the house 3 years ago and at that time, judgements showed up when lender did a search. The judgement are 15 years old at this point and ultimately was not an issue when buying and we did not need to pay them off. These judgements have been paid off from wage garnishments years ago but the creditors never notified the courts. Lender isn't accepting this as proof.

I recently tried to reach the creditors (former doctors) but they cannot be found. All phone numbers associated with them are not in service. Their office no longer exists and Google maps last showed their office in 2017. Other results show the people are 85+ years old but I haven't found any obituaries and not even sure these people are located in the state anymore. Additionally, all have had their medical license expire.

Been trying to refinance since October but every lender gives us trouble on judgements. When we reached out to previous attorney who handled closing, he said this should not be a problem and to find a new lender which we did but same issue.

I called the court and they mentioned we can file a motion for the judge to vacate the judgements. Been trying to Google this and I cannot figure out what form(s) to submit.

104,Roth IRA Contribution Using Foreign Income,"Hi,

I'm an university student studying in the UK and was fortunate to have worked an internship in summer 2020, which earned me \~£7k or \~$9.7k. I want to use this income to fund a Roth IRA with $6k in 2020. Is there anything I need to know about using foreign income to do this? I've paid income tax and national insurance on this income already so when I file for US taxes, I plan to file using Foreign Tax Credit which should mean I don't pay any US income tax. Would this mean I can't contribute to my Roth? Further, I will probably receive my income tax back sometime this summer because I made under the minimum income for taxation, so do I need to worry about that?

107,Should I take the mortgate loan with the higher interest rate?,"Hi everyone,  

I'm under contract for a house and I need to make my final decision for which loan I am going to go with by today. 

I have two loan options available, both of them have down payment assistance, but one loan has forgivable down payment assistance while the other is not forgivable. The loan which has loan forgiveness on the down payment has a higher interest rate, but it's a conventional loan instead of an FHA, which means I won't have to refinance to avoid paying mortgage insurance once I have reached the required equity of 20%. As you may know, the FHA loans have PMI which does not ever go away for the life of the loan unless you refinance the loan. I do plan on selling/refinancing around the 5-10 year mark. It is because of this, that I am leaning with a conventional loan even though it has a higher interest rate. Here's my reasoning below, and I'm hoping someone can spot check my sanity and make sure it sounds good.  
[Here are both of the loans for your viewing.](https://imgur.com/gallery/PhYxUbx) As you can see, the FHA loan has a cheaper monthly cost, but I'm paying much more for PMI when compared to the conventional loan. Once the conventional loan has an equity of 20%, I automatically get the mortgage insurance dropped off and it will have a cheaper monthly than the FHA loan. The FHA loan, you can't drop PMI ever unless you refinance the loan. I am estimating that this will cost ~ $4000 to close a new loan for refinance. 
On the conventional loan, even though I'm paying a higher interest rate, there's a big win in it due to the loan forgiveness. After 36 months of consecutive payments, my down payment assistance loan ($12,804) is automatically forgiven and I don't have to repay it. In the meantime, the loan requires no repayment and has 0% interest. So 5 years down the road, the FHA loan looks about $12,095 dollars cheaper, but it doesn't come with that sweet loan forgiveness. At that 5 year point, regardless of FHA or conventional loan, I will probably start looking at either selling or refinancing. Which means maybe I get that conventional loan down to under 4% interest rate. Or maybe, I refinance the FHA loan to avoid PMI, and then end up with a higher interest rate that cancels out savings on PMI. This is my worry with the FHA and the low interest rate.   
What would you guys choose? Is it smart to go with the conventional loan even though it has a higher interest rate? Let me know!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m1fs9l/should_i_take_the_mortgate_loan_with_the_higher/,1615322556.0,1,1,0
108,Capital one Debt,"Hello all,

Let me start off saying I’m not really trying to get out of debt, simply trying to get them off my butt. I’ve already cashed my savings in and keeping that, but need to know if I should do this. 

I owe capital one (or the debt collector now) $800 dollars. They recently served me a small claims court notice. 

I currently make $150-200 a week in CT with state assistance for college, housing and food. The state assistance is exempt from debt collectors; I’m not worried about that. 

I really don’t want to go to court, but they already served me a claim. However, even if the try to garnish my wages, by CT law I’m also exempt because I make less than 40 times minimum wage. 

So my real question is this: should I call the debt collector and be like “I’m exempt so you can’t get your money anyways, but I’ll settle for $100-$150” or something along those lines? I just want the debt to be resolved so I don’t have to deal with this anymore. I just don’t know if that will work, or if it will make things worse.

109,"I know about UK inheritance tax thresholds when gifts are given before death, but what about when loans are given and partially paid back?","My wife and I asked my mum for roughly 11k for IVF treatment in 2018 (after 1 failed attempt with the NHS) which was successful. My mum has around 150k in cash in various banks just sitting there after dad passed in 2013, but she wanted it to be a loan. My dad sorted all the money side of things out so she's not too savvy with it all, so she does tend to fret over it. I have no issues with it being a loan, she got one of her friends to draw up a contract where I pay her the agreed £200 per month until it's all paid off. If mum is happy, I'm happy. I'd love £200 a month but I love my daughter more and she's priceless, I'd have robbed a bank if the bank of mum wasn't an issue.

So I'm about to ask for more for a mortgage as we want to buy the house we rent through the right to aquire scheme. I'd like to go down the early inheritance route but I'm more than willing to top up the loan, even if it means more payments per week, this will be something we have to hash out.

So my big question is.. 

How does tax work if she passes within the tax timeframe? Will they take into account how much I've paid back? So for example if I had 11k off her, paid 6k back at time of death, would I be liable for only 5k to be taxed?

Also, anyone else asked mum and dad for early inheritance? Any advice?

Hello... I've been looking everywhere and I can't seem to find an answer on this question... I bought a home in Orange County, California a few months ago and opened an impound account for insurance / property tax. Confused between ""Property Tax"" and ""County Property Tax"".   


During closing, I paid for 6 months of property taxes at $788.26 / month = $4729. In addition, I pay the same monthly amount each month to cover property taxes twice a year. But at closing, I also paid for county taxes at a rate of $2922 prorated for Dec 1 - Dec 31.   


Why are there two line-items for property taxes? I can understand that the 6 months pre-paid amount covers Jan 1 - Jun 30, and the second line item covers Dec 1- Dec 31, but confused as to why the latter is prorated at a $2922 rate; where Jan 1 - Jan 30 is paid at a $4729 rate.   


Is this the result of appreciation on the home since I paid more than what the ""Total Net Taxable Value"" is?   


or  


Are there state and county taxes that are different? So I will pay $2922 every half year for county property taxes and $4729 every half year for state property taxes?   


Called my bank and they just keep saying we will pay for it and refund you if we over-collected, but noone has been able to explain the discrepancy here in the values.

I had over $6,000 in a 401(a) through my old employer where I would contribute pre-tax contributions. I left this job and submitted paperwork to roll it over into a Roth IRA. I called HR several times to make sure everything was fine and it wouldn't be taxed, but I just received a 1099-R that says the entire amount is taxable (listed in box 2a).

If it goes to a Roth, is 30% the rate it will actually be taxed? Would opening a traditional IRA for this money be the best move?

130,Roth IRA vs save for medical school?,"I'm a junior in college (21 yo) planning to go straight into medical school once I graduate. I've been reading about Roth IRAs and am considering opening one. However, I know I'll likely have to take out loans for med school (average is anywhere between 150k-200k in loans). I have no debt from undergrad. 

I'm a bit lost - should I open a Roth IRA before the 4/15 deadline and max it out, or should I be using that money to save for medical school so I don't have to take out as many loans? Also, will I be able to take money out of my Roth IRA for medical school since it's a higher education expense? Any advice is appreciated.

132,Looking for Advice for Purchasing Insurance for a first time home buyer,"My lending company got me two quotes from two different insurance companies and I'm not sure where to go. 

I was offered an incredibly low prem. (less than 400) a year. But it is with minimal coverage however it's enough to cover the cost of the house plus like an extra 10 thousand. It's around 42k for personal contents but my partner and I don't keep expensive stuff. We're more likely to put that in experiences / food and savings?   


Still my brother in law thinks it'd be smarted to pay for the higher prem (600) to get more coverage on the house, so we don't have to start from scratch again should anything happen to the house.

135,NJ Family Leave Benefit Question,"Hey all, first time poster, long time reader. I am reaching out to the community for help since this is a pretty specific question and google doesn't help much.

My wife received family leave benefit payments in January 2021. These benefit payments were retroactively paid out for the work she had missed in December 2020. For example, she had to take a leave from work from December 9th to December 15th. She received a benefits payment on January 4th for that missed week. 

Will we need to file these benefit payments in the 2020 tax year or 2021 tax year? I am thinking 2021 because that is the year she received the actual payment. Also, when attempting to print out a 2020 1099-G form, it comes out blank.

136,IRA help - I have both traditional and roth,"I have neglected my finances for years. I'm 36 now, and just started contributing to IRAs a few years back and I've been bad at it. I haven't even made selections. I intend to talk to my bank (fidelty) for help, but I've been told to know that they will push you towards selections that make them more money so i'm doing some research before i contact them.

I saw some good advice on here for absolute beginners, but was looking for advice for someone who is a beginner with knowledge, but not a beginner at contributing.

Background: My wife and I are gig workers with no 401k, so after a million people told us to do IRAs we finally listened. our agi has fluctuated over the past few years. I hover on the roth income limits. some years i've been able to do roth, but most years i have to do traditional. i've been told i should have been doing backdoor conversions? wtf?

Currently we both have in our own individual accounts:

TRADITIONAL: $11537.41

ROTH: $5552.86

For 2020, we can contribute to a roth, but are contributing the full amount of $6000 to traditional as it puts us under 150k agi in the household and we receive a windfall in stimulus. should we each do a backdoor with this as well?

Looking for advice. Should we move the traditional over to roth? what's the appropriate way to do that? and any advice for selections at our age through fidelity? just want to know what to look for before a sales guy steers me in the wrong direction that benefits them more than me.

138,Husband got job offer I’m worried is a scam,"Hello I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this. 

My husband applied for a job last month, it was advertised on LinkedIn and he applied directly through the company website. The job is out of state as we are planning to move there. It is a legit company with tons of info about them online. 

He was contacted within a few days by HR, had a phone interview and then he had a second longer interview the next week with a manager. After that they invited him to the next step which was to do a business presentation to a few staff members which he did on Microsoft Teams. This was done on video chat and he was able to see everyone and talk to them, all were American. He also has looked at all these people’s profiles on LinkedIn.

After the presentation he had another interview with a different manager and they offered him the job some days after with an official offer letter. He went to do a pre-employment drug screening and sent info for a background check.

Everything seems legit... but very early this morning he got an email from someone with a foreign name, with the company name as their email, with a list of attachments to fill out which look normal. However in the email they also asked for “a copy of his passport and a cancelled cheque.” which doesn’t make any sense as a job never needs this information. My husband is from out of the country, but still weird, why would they need his passport? They also shouldn’t need a cancelled check.

the person had no signature in her email and there were several misspellings/poor grammar. BIG red flag. The form for filling out bank details for pay also looked super sketchy to me. It of course asks for routing and account numbers but also asks for a swift code. I’ve never had a job ask for this, it makes no sense. I’ve told him not to submit any of this information until he calls and speaks with HR tomorrow.

Now something important to note is that the original, smaller company did originate in South Africa, so they do have some employees who work there. It’s possible this person just has poor English and that would also explain her spelling of “cheque.” 

Everything else up until this point has been normal but I’m just getting nervous. Does anyone think this may be a very very elaborate scheme?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0wxae/husband_got_job_offer_im_worried_is_a_scam/,1615257971.0,18,18,0

144,"Realized Mom Can't Contribute to ROTH IRA, Feeling dumb","I'm feeling really dumb and guilty because I think I led my mom down the wrong road. For background, she speaks limited English and her job does not have a 401K plan. I've been doing my parents' taxes for over a decade now. They are currently filing Married Filing Separate in order for my dad to have an affordable student loan payment. Having said that:

* My mom filed MFS for tax year 2019 but will file jointly for 2020 and 2021
* I opened a ROTH IRA for her because she did not benefit from a traditional IRA because of filing status
* She has been maxing out her roth in 2019, 2020, and made her 2021 contribution.
* She makes over $10K (both my parents make $4K each), the limit for Roth and her filing status.
* She has a Roth and Traditional with vanguard

My question is, what would be the best way to fix this? Since she has not yet filed her 2020 taxes, I was thinking of recharacterizing the 2021 contribution and 2020 one as well then filing joint for 2020 and 2021 to take advantage of the traditional deduction. If I did that, what would I do about the 2019 contribution? Further, would I do two separate recharacterizations or just one?

I'm feeling pretty guilty right now because she's been trusting me with all this and I just until now realized that the limit for MFS is $10K. Big fan of this sub!

148,Help Interpreting Car Title Lien Search,"Hi,

New to paying off car loans.  Long story short.  Re-financed an auto-loan on a new car.  I believe the old lender sent directly to the new lender a title and transfer of lien.  That was about 6 months ago.  Everything was fine until two months ago when the new lender said they never got the title and have no collateral on the loan.  I handled that poorly by not following up. New lender put my loan at 14% interest for no title and no collateral, so I payed them off today--immediately.  


After paying them off I called them basically saying, ""well what now?""  They claim they have no lien, no title, no collateral and I appear to have payed them off, but then I asked the question ""who is going to send me the title?""  New lender doesn't have it and the old lender sent it to the new lender, so I got put on hold and then phone treed again (mysteriously).

My brother-in-law thinks the new lender lost it and now nobody is going to fess up to it.

To help sort things out I did a lien search in my local state, and that looks okay.  Facts appear right.  I own the car, but there was a couple of fields I didn't precisely know how to interpret and I thought you folks might be some help.

<snip>

**Pending Lien Information**

**State Pending Lien Count:** 0

 **First Lien Information** 

**<first lender contact info>**

<end snip>

Q1: Does the state pending lien count: 0 mean the title is unencumbered by liens?

Q2: Is the first lien information largely irrelevant now?

Q3: The second lender isn't mentioned anywhere this is consistent with the facts right?

155,IRA vs Roth IRA and Compound Interest,"Hello,

Forgive me as I am a beginner when it comes to the world of personal finance. As far as I can tell, many people seem to support a Roth IRA account over a traditional IRA as tax rates are likely to increase in the future. However, I'm confused as to how compound interest and less money in a Roth IRA (after taxes) would effect the difference between the two account types.

If someone with a traditional IRA and someone else with a Roth IRA were to make the same investments, with the same amount of money, is there any chance that the traditional IRA would beat the Roth IRA as Roth would be taxed today—meaning less money in the account? Could the compound interest of a traditional IRA theoretically beat the tax rates of tomorrow?

157,"What is mortgage ""recasting""?","I have checked the description a few times on few spots and either I am a little slow in my head or I still do not get it. I just don't get it.

Imagine you have a plain vanilla normal 30 years mortgage loan for 300k, house value is maybe 400k, not important. LTV is less than 80%. There is an amortization calendar, which is a fancy way to say that portion that goes to the principal rises over time, which is sort of logical. 

Say your payment (Principal + Interest only, let's ignore escrow for taxes and insurance) is $1,200 per month. In month 1 you pay 30 days of interest of those $300,000 you borrowed, and that may be $900, and $300 goes to the principal, so in month 2, you pay 30 days of interest of $299,700 (because you paid off those $300 last month) so your $1,200 paid in the month 2 goes maybe $895 to interest (now you owe them little less) and $305 to principal, and, at the end of month 2 you have $299,295 (300,000-(300+305)) balance. All those numbers are evaluated on daily basis, not monthly. Your month 3 breakdown would be $310 to the principal, and $890 to interest. The balance remaining at the end of month 3 would be 300,000-(300+305+310) = $299,085

So far all clear? All correct? Let's look at scenario A: If you pay little extra on the principal, maybe 1,000 on the 15th day of the 2nd month, then, suddenly on day 16 of that month, you have even less borrowed, and instead of using 300,000-(300+305) to calculate your daily interest, you need to use 300,000-(300+305+1,000) from day 16 of that month, right? Your extra principal is reflected in the day it was received. It starts lowering your interest (because you lowered the base of what you have borrowed) immediately, the next day. Right? 

So what is recasting? It will not change the rate. So what does it do? Why should I want to do it? What are the advantages? Since it is paid with a fee, I assume it will make lender somewhat unhappy, otherwise they would promote it and not motivate you to avoid it.

158,"Bonus imminent, notify HMRC?","Hi all,

Long time lurker here and have posted previously which was very helpful.

Looking for some finance advise - despite everything that happened last year my company had a very good year, to show appreciation for that we are receiving our managerial bonuses paid in April or May pay cheque.

Up until January this year I was earning £45,000 + £6000 car allowance a year. In January I received a pay rise increasing my basic pay to £50,000. 

My question is, when I receive my 10% bonus ( based on last years basic wage ), do I need to let HMRC know this is a one off payment? I have heard that they can sometimes put you on emergency tax because they think your  wage has increased. Will this put me into the higher earning tax bracket and mean I am paying more tax % this year?

Any help is much appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m1c9r2/bonus_imminent_notify_hmrc/,1615313015.0,1,1,0

I have tried calling around a couple of tax services and CPAs and they are saying that they cannot answer tax questions without doing my taxes themselves because of the liabilities that would open. So that means answering my questions would take 300 to $500.

I am also aware that whenever you request a wedding cake, there is a 50% surcharge tax because ""wedding"" whereas if you just order a white cake it cost much less.. So I am hoping that you guys can help me find what I really need a bit cheaper.

The laptop model is a Samung Notebook NP550P7C, I was going to buy a new cheap one when I can afford. However, my friend said it's better to just fix the problems over time. So basically buying a new battery, keys, and he said the fan should still work if I clean inside.

163,Another House Poor Question...,"Hi all, looking for further guidance. Wife and I are looking to purchase a new home, and are dead set on a high cost of living area with amazing schools - BUT having second thoughts given our finances. We have 3 young kids. Here is what we are pre approved for 

Details:

Home Purchas price: 1,330,000

Down payment: 332,500

MTG: 997,500

&#x200B;

Estimated MTG payment with property taxes, etc is around 7,000. Our take-home income monthly after taxes, 401K, and 529 payments, is about 16K. Wife and I make about the same. No other debts. I make a bonus (30K this past year) but can be variable so not counting it here. 

So our mortgage payment would eat up a significant portion of our take home (43%). Wife works in medical field and has very secure job - mine less so. So the worst case would be we would lose my salary. Likely wife would never have to worry. High end estimates, I'm assuming about 3.5K in monthly credit card balances (non revolving), 2K in child care - but hopeully would go down once kids are in school. So leaving maybe only 3,000 - 3,500 each month left over. BUT this doesn't account for any home expenses. I think we can leave back 80K in cash between wife and post closure.

165,Worth refinancing auto loan?,"Hello everyone,

My current auto loan balance is $19k with an interest rate of 3.59% and I pay $451 a month. I've had this for about 3 years and have already paid off about $10k worth since. I've refinanced once a few years ago to get that rate; I think I have 3 or 4 years left on it, I honestly don't remember. I've since gotten a better job and have better cash flow, so I was recently thinking of making a large $10k payment on it just to get the balance down.

With all of that in mind, would it make sense to refinance my auto loan after making the $10k payment with the same provider to get a lower monthly payment? Or does it make more sense to just stick out the remainder, paying extra as I'm able? 

I'm not totally strapped for money, but having a lower monthly payment on top of my other obligations would definitely be nice. I really doubt the rate would change, but my credit is much better since the start (hovers around 799). Any input/thoughts are appreciated.

I can manage getting her to pay off her credit cards just fine, but my question is with her car loan.

Apparently the bank didn't think her car was worth the total loan amount, so they did part auto loan and part personal loan. Not sure on the starting mix, but right now she owes something like $1700 on the auto part, and $7300 on the personal loan. I want to get rid of the car since it's an unreliable POS and get something good that will fit 5+ the dog. Would we be able to pay off the $1700 amount and get the title to sell the car? Or would the personal loan hold that up? I wouldn't think the personal loan would be secured by the car since they didn't want to finance it in the first place, but who knows.

&#x200B;

I am currently in the process of moving to a new house. I am still debating whether I should sell my current townhouse or rent out . I bought the house for 310 in 2017 , market value now around 370-390, owe 266k on it. Given it's a hot sellers market , I can just cash out now. Or do I rent it out at around 2500 maybe a bit less. Mortgage payment will increase from 2220 to 2300 due to converting homeowners insurance policy to Landlord. Equity payment for now since I refinanced 6 months ago is 470. So sounds like I may barely break even (from a cash flow perspective , not including equity) when I account for expenses. Not to mention vacancies or bad tenants. What's attractive though is the long term benefit of someone paying down a mortgage , and I can continue to increase my equity overtime. My township to is also building a train station (NJ ) that would take folks into the city. That may end up accelerating the appreciation of this property, though not sure how appealing that is anymore given the whole WFH trend. What are your thoughts , should I keep it or sell it ?

181,2021 Child Tax Credit -- should I delay filing 2020?,"Hey all,

We find ourselves in the (enviable, I'll admit it) situation of being right on the threshold for the phaseout of both the 2021 recovery payments and child tax credit as passed by the Senate on Saturday, and assumably to be passed by the House and signed into law this week, unless disaster strikes.

We intentionally delayed filing our 2020 taxes while this was being hammered out, and our patience is going to be rewarded; while our AGI in 2019 was eligible for the full amount, our 2020 AGI would have completely cut us off from payments (just over $160,000 joint).

The child tax credit has a broader phaseout. The text of the law is to have a monthly payout of half the credit over the last half of the year, using the same method of ""use 2020 data if available, else 2019, no repayment of overpayment required"".

I understand there are a lot of unknowns here, especially around timing and when exactly they would be looking at the data for the purpose of calculating the payments, but I'll ask anyway for the experts out there -- would it makes sense to file for an extension and wait until October to file our 2020 returns? Are there any potential downfalls to doing that? Conversely -- since we don't owe, would it be beneficial to delay filing even longer since we would not be penalized? We are owed around $1k in refund for 2020 which I understand would be delayed by filing late, so just trying to decide if the juice is worth the squeeze here.

(and to head off the horde of angry PMs -- yes, I understand that I'm exploiting a loophole here and that maybe I'm not the #1 intended recipient of this money, but frankly I'm happy to pay any tax I'm legally required to pay and will do so without complaint, but I'm also not going to pass up funds I'm legally entitled to.

182,Need advice on Debt Collection,"Bottom Line Up Top:  I have $2.5k in debt that a hospital sent to a collections agency and would like advice on whether to negotiate this or just pay it in full.

Longer version.  My wife had surgery in 2019, it was a complete and utter debacle.  We received from the insurance company a notice the week prior to surgery that one line item was not considered medically necessary.  There was a hurricane due in Florida, we had to re-schedule pre-surgery stuff.  We called the insurance, they said it was the wrong code.  We called the hospital, they said ""Don't worry about it, come in for your surgery, we will take care of it""

They didn't take care of it.  They billed me for 100% of that line item after the insurance denied the claim.  I fought with them for a few months, prior to getting Health Advocate involved.  I took the position that I wasn't paying anything until this was resolved.  I filed multiple appeals with the insurance company, received no support from the hospital.  It's just been an all around disaster.

We are still fighting through one appeal on the line item involving the denied code, but there were 8 other line items.  The hospital sent 4 of those 8 to a collection agency.  Two were paid by insurance and I don't know why the other 2 were not forwarded but they remain at the hospital.  Despite all the requests to hold this bill until the insurance is resolved.

I am told that once the Collection Agency has the debt, it can not be given back.  So if I understand correctly, my options are to either pay the amount in full and hope it never hits my credit.  Or offer the collection agency a lesser amount and the difference will hit me as income at the end of the year.

Is there a huge credit implication if I negotiate it down?

My OPT expired last year and I left the country in September 2020. Then I opened a new bank account in my country and the balance in it exceeds $10,000 USD. However, I don't think I need to file FBAR with this year's tax returns because I opened that account after I left and am technically under no tax obligations to the US but only to my home country. Does anyone have experience with this and can give me an advice? It's highly appreciated!

188,Advice for getting best mortgage rates with least hassle/best service once you find a home your looking to buy,"So just some background on my current financial situation, i'm a new homebuyer i'm making over $100k yearly salary and steady work history, credit score is over 750 and no debt, i'm planning on putting 20% down for a condo/coop and my max loan would be $240k after down payment..

At a high level i understand i just need a one pre-approval letter before any realtor or buyer will take my offer seriously so the initial lender i apply with doesn't matter it's just to get my foot in the door and show proof i'm able to buy the home.

So is it better to apply to multiple lenders at the same time before making an offer to be able to go back to them after your offer was accepted to save time and see who's going to give you the best rate, or better to apply to them after your offer is accepted? Again not sure if i'm missing something in this process or i'm on point. Also will applying to multiple places at same time will ding my credit score?

With that, i find it annoying and stressfull dealing with sales people who are going round robbin around your questions and also trying to sell you on using there real estate broker who's also there cousin, brother, sister, boyfriends.. etc.. As much as i want the best rate as well, how do i make sure i get good service with least hassle/delay? are large banks better, local credit unions, others.. any suggestions what service or lender is generally give you a competitive enough rate with the least amount of headache/hassle/ and delays?

191,Suntrust Bank took all our money! What do we do?,"On March 3rd, 2021, my husband was out and tried to buy a cheeseburger, when his card declined. He called me to let me know his card was not working and asked if i could get to the bottom of it. I had noticed the previous day, that the app on my phone for our bank, SUNTRUST, was not letting me login as i was trying to check our funds for budgeting, and i assumed the app was being updated so i didn't bother with it. all in all, i ended up calling the customer service phone number on the back of my debit card, which connected me with a representative to whom i explained the current situtation. The representative began to stutter and could barely get a sentence out without placing an ""umm"" between every word, which instantly gave me anxiety. As she procceeded to answer my question as to why my card was not working, she stated ""The account has been closed, Suntrust decided they will no longer continue banking with you as per a 'routine review' of their accounts"". As you could imagine, i was instantly irate, Due to the fact that all of my husband and I's funds were in this one sole account, and i had not recieved ANY notification of closure or review. I instantly hung up the phone, and decided i would go down to my local branch, because surely this was some mistake.

As i arrived at the branch, i sat down with a banker in a very humid glass office, and kindly explained what the representative had told me on the phone, but that i had no knowledge of why this would have happened. The banker seemed confused as if this had never occured before, and procceeded to pull up my account. As he read over the notes, he remained quiet which i found odd. He turned to me and very plainly stated ""there are no notes in regards to the situtation, im not sure why, there is just a phone number provided for you to contact for more information, im sorry."" and handed me a paper with the said phone number on it.

I walked out of the building, and called the number in my car from the parking lot. It brought up the automated system for the suntrust fraud department, which then led to me to a representative with an international accent, most likely indian, which led me to assume this was an offshore phone number. I again had to explain my situation and yet AGAIN no explanation could be provided.

At this point, i was now past anger, and my emotions grew into fear, where is my money!?

I walked back into the branch, unsatisfied with the service being provided from this institution, and requested to speak with the manager. He politely led me into his office, as i again explained the situation. as the banker before had, the manager pulled my account up and read through what seemed like an endless amounts of notes, yet could not provide an explantion. He stated he had to call the 'back office' who are responsible for account closures, placed the call on speaker but as soon as someone picked up, placed it on a personal call so i could not hear the responses. The manager explained what was going on, and asked ""is there any information that i CAN provide to the client?"" which flew a huge red flag for me.. what do you mean what you can tell me? its my money for god sake, don't hide information.. but anyways, he continued on and could only state that the fraud department was reviewing my account and they decided to close the account. he could not provide any timeframe for when i would recieve my money, but that it would come through a check in the mail. I cried right there unapologetically, this bank took all our money, won't give us access to it online to even verify the amount in the account, and won't provide any further information.

I have no money to pay the bills, feed my family, put gas in the car. I don't know how this is even legal, as i have seen many other people's testimonies reporting the same, with no luck for a resolution. We had thousands of dollars in this account, and they took it all without remorse or explanation.

What do we do now? Get a lawyer? How do we pay?

If this has happened to you, i am so sorry, but this just can't be legal.

Technically we don't even have the mortgage yet but by the info we have been given it seems promising.

However, the guy/company we are dealing with is dreadful. We have been trying to get this process done since mid-January. We rushed to get our taxes done and even paid more to have the filing rushed. We are on a time limit because of our lease in our apartment that we really don't wanna be stuck in for another year.

We call him and he never answers. We leave voicemails that are never returned. We send emails that go unanswered. Last time we spoke with him was back on 2/26. He said that the pre-approval would be finalized by that following Tuesday but alas we never heard from him. We have sent emails and left voicemails and nothing. 

At this point I really don't want to give this person our business but again we don't have many options due to our situation. Plus I don't want to have to start this process over again and another company be just as bad. So when can I tell this guy how terrible he has been? Do I have to wait until things are signed?

Since then I followed all the steps to verify the identity fraud and we had to mail our return. Did all of this last April. Finally got a notice from the IRS in December verifying the fraud, but our mailed return is still out there somewhere and hasn’t been processed or accepted. I’ve called the IRS several times and keep being told to wait.

Now that it looks like this new stimulus will pass, this will be another 5600 we still won’t receive. We have another baby due this April and could really use all of this money.

201,Can I claim a tax deduction on home office equipment?,"I live in PA, and my employer has required me to work from home since March 2020, so I just hit a full year (as I'm sure is the case for many people).

I know the federal tax returns no longer allow for home office deductions, but it appears certain states do, and PA is one of them. Here's what I found online:

>**Pennsylvania** allows certain deductions on [PA Schedule UE](https://www.revenue.pa.gov/GeneralTaxInformation/Tax%20Types%20and%20Information/PIT/UnreimbursedExpenses/Pages/default.aspx) as unreimbursed business expenses.  These expenses must be actual expenses (not estimated), reasonable, necessary - a condition of employment (not a convenience), ordinary expenses that are directly related to the business, and were not reimbursed.  Examples of some acceptable deductions are union dues, professional license fee, and office work area expenses (must be principal place of work).  Pennsylvania allows any of these allowable deductions for any type of compensation and is not limited to self-employed individuals.

So I guess my question is... can I claim something like an office desk chair (which I would think is considered a necessity, not a ""convenience,"" and was not reimbursed by my employer)? My computer was provided to me and I already had a desk set up, so it would really just be the chair that I'd be interested in deducting, but I don't know if I can or whether it's even worth it?

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide. I posted about this yesterday on r/taxes but only got one response and I think the person was unaware of PA's specific deduction policy as they told me nothing could be deducted if I have a W2, but that contradicts what I'm reading above.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m18tay/can_i_claim_a_tax_deduction_on_home_office/,1615303828.0,1,1,0

207,Advice needed on Universal Life Insurance that I was given as a kid,"Hi all,

When I was a kid, my parents opened a ""Universal Life"" policy for me with Farmers Insurance - this would have been the mid-80s. I have a very limited understanding of this, but these are the nuts and bolts:

* I pay $130/month in premium.
* I'm in my late 40's.
* There's some clause about it ending when I turn 70 or so. I could be wrong about this.
* I believe it pays out $100k if I die tomorrow, plus whatever cash value I accrue? But...
* The policy accrued some kind of monetary value, but I withdrew that (some $5k) decades ago to pay off a credit card debt. My yearly statements now indicate that there's interest on that withdrawal that is growing, to the tune of some $13k to pay it back? If I understand correctly, the $100k value of the policy if I die tomorrow would be $100k - the $13k interest -> roughly $85k.
* The paperwork for the policy is many pages, but I am also unable to get to it easily at the moment as it's buried in storage boxes.

I haven't paid too much attention to this over the past few decades, unfortunately, but my monthly rate has started to climb from $60 to $90 and now $130, and I feel like I need to make a decision.

My limited understanding is that I'm better off just cancelling it outright. I don't believe I need to pay back the ""interest"", and I my understanding is that I frankly don't need this policy at all. If I die tomorrow, my retirement accounts and social security will provide plenty of security for my wife and kid, certainly more than this policy.

I could pay back the interest of $13k or so, but it doesn't feel like ""investing"" $130/month into this is frankly worthwhile.

I would welcome any help or advice on this.

211,Stuck in a toxic job while expecting a baby,"Hello, using a throwaway account since my other account has a bunch of followers and is known within several communities. 

The good news is, my husband and I are expecting our first child later this summer. We're thrilled and can't wait to be parents. We're lucky to have super supportive families, and both of our jobs will give us about 3 months off for paid new parent leave. 

However, my current job, aside from the upcoming paid leave, is kind of a nightmare. My team and I are woefully overworked and understaffed. I'm averaging 50-60 hour weeks at a marketing agency, in what's essentially an associate position. I'm not entry level, but I'm not a manager. I sometimes feel like I'm too good at what I do because lots of teams and projects are tapping into me for support, and I routinely get high marks from performance reviews. 

My mangers know about my over-utilization, and have assured me they're looking to provide me with additional support by brining in a new hire to work parallel to me. I've been hearing this since October though, and we still haven't so much as interviewed someone else. 

Having that person would help a ton, not to mention how important they'll be once I leave for 3 months later this year. But if it weren't for our upcoming kid, I'd have left this place by now. My colleagues and supervisors are nice and mean well, but resource management sucks. Everyone is underwater and one new hire isn't going to pave the way for a better work life balance - which is all I really want, especially considering my growing family. 

Alas, we work in the United States where many employers won't offer paid leave to someone who's worked less than a year. I'm trying to assess my options, for my mental health any my future as a new parent, but I'm nervous that all I can do is wait till I'm on new parent leave, and then start looking for a new position after that. 

Maybe it's as ""simple"" as that, but thought I'd seek additional advice in case I have options that I'm not considering. Any advice or insight would be welcome.

However, due to the economy and some other corporate jargon, our yearly raises were a puny 1.5%, not even the 2020 inflation rate. I asked my boss if this was negotiable and was told, ""unless you had something specific I could take my bosses to talk about."" I felt pretty shafted given that my company hired a new CEO this year, bought another company, and a job posting for my department started 18/hr, more than I'm making now.

I took this to mean, I should get a job offer for better. So I put my resume out to a few places. I didn't anticipate such a quick response, but I did. 

I'm currently making 17.50/hr in a permanent full-time position with 2 weeks PTO per year, great health care, a good boss, a remote job with a company that I like.

I have an interview scheduled this afternoon for a ""long term contract"" job (the company hires in 1 year contract increments) for 21/hr. Remote job. No PTO. Health care opt-in, but the quality is unknown and I don't know how expensive it will be. Also unknown are the coworkers/boss.

There's also the factor that my current job is located in NH, no income tax, and the new job is located in MA, so I'll be paying more taxes, so that also lowers my take home. 

According to the recruiter, this position is going to go quickly, like, I'm interviewing today and could have a job offer either today or tomorrow.

When do I bring this to my boss? When I have a solid offer? After the interview, if I feel like it went well? How long do I keep the new offer hanging with the new company while I wait for my current company to get back to me? How do I navigate this so that I get the best for myself out of this situation?

215,Refinancing home - Missed Opportunity - Please help.,"My sister went with better.com for their mortgage refinance. The company locked the rate, my sister supplied them with all the needed documents the next day. The interest rates have gone up considerably, they are  still in a locked period, but it looks like better.com doesn't want to refinance now. They are not answering any of her calls or replying to her emails. She supplied all the documents needed and she is very qualified to get the rates. This is cheating and dishonesty. But is it illegal? Can a company back off from its promise of the locked rate, just because the rates have gone up?  What steps can she take to resolve this? This is very frustrating. Is there a place where she can complain about the companies unethical behavior?

She is contemplating on taking this to Social Media. Make a video testimonial. Most probably she will never get her low rates again, but at least she can make other customers aware of the companies behavior? Is this fine?

Should she ask the company to charge her a couple of more thousand dollars in closing cost and give her the locked rates?

I called the collection agency(Cavalry) that has my file to try and setup a payment. I know from reading the FAQ to do everything by mail or email, I just wanted to get the ball rolling over the phone. Well they told me to contact this law firm I had never heard of to take payment. So I call them because mail would be too slow to figure how who I’m supposed to be talking to here. Caling them, I learn the law firm does have my file, and they know the exact amount, etc., plus the terms the collections agency had offered for me to pay off. (30%)

My question is, is this normal? I’ve never heard of this before. The law firm is ready to take my payment via mail or online, I just want to make sure Cavalry knows I’m paying the thing off. The law firm sent me an official looking pdf laying out the terms, deadline, etc.

**Bonus question:** is it better to pay by check via snail mail or use the firm’s online payment system which is with checking info/no debit card? Either way it’s paid by check.

223,15yr vs 30yr refi and the specifics of investing the monthly difference. I'm looking for a strategy to bring to the table for my wife to consider. Is FZROX the way?,"So we're in our first home, just a little over a year into the mortgage. Paying PMI, 30yrs, just over 4%, the totality of the loan comes to ~530k over 30 years for our 260k home. A refi definitely sounds great now. 

Initially, the wife wanted to get into a 15yr refi with the monthly payments staying roughly the same. Sounds good on paper, but after researching I'm seeing the comments of the market outperforming I'm wondering if we should be staying at 30 years. We both had significant promotions( just under 130k annually) and would like to be in a different house without 5-10 years fwiw.

Fast forward to now, 3 collections (2 ER visits and a XRAY from my stay while I was sick) from the hospital went to collections. each opened up in Nov 2020.  which is a **HUGE** surprise because I **NEVER** received a notice that I owed anything in 6 years.

I already called the hospital and they told me that I got 100% financial assistance that should have covered everything and the final amount I owed was indeed 0,  she said sometimes the message gets muddled from Physician to billing and so she game me a number for Billing, which then gave me a number for Pendrick collections, which gave me the number for the agency that has my collection on my credit report, smoothing sailing so far....

Until I called the collections agency, they didn't care for anything I said at all, I told them there was a mistake and the debt was already paid and he said they needed proof that everything was paid...which I tried to give to him (lady at the hospital said to give them my patient # and they can give a quick call to confirm) , but it was like he stuck fingers in his ears and was saying ""LALALALALALALA!"" rinse and repeat like 10 times and said that their policy is they can't talk to the hospital to check **EVER**. (which I know is a absolute lie.)

So where do I go from here? all this debt collection stuff is new to me and i'm scared i'll never get rid of this off my report which until recently have been trying to build.

I purchased something from Best Buy using the my best buy credit card and it started crapping out and giving me tons of problem to this day. I tried reaching out to the manufacturer and they did not help and the item basically becoming useless. It cost me about $500 and I paid minimum payments on the card until it got down to a balance of $396 at which point the device just basically malfunctions a lot.


I then looked into my card agreement and found that I could dispute the charge if I am dissatisfied with a purchase and have tried all options to remedy the situation in good faith.

I submitted this dispute with Best Buy credit card on November 2nd, 2020 and the card is issued by Citi bank. I initially sent a letter to them (because the agreement said to send something in writing) which got no response so I called them. After calling them, they initiated a dispute and then sent me correspondence saying that as long as the investigation is ongoing, I would not have to make any payments.

I called last week after not hearing back for months and was informed that they JUST started working on the investigation of February 18th, more than 90 days later. But i called them back because I am now seeing a minimum payment on my card.

I don’t mind paying off this whole thing if I actually had a useful product however the product is basically not working and I have tried all options.

I called the credit card department at best buy and explained that I was told I don’t need to make payments til an investigation is complete, and now I have a minimum payment. They stated they will work on getting it removed and I won’t need to call back.

It’s been a week now and the payment is still there, and the payment is due on the 20th.

- If I make a payment, isn’t that basically me cancelling the dispute?
- Are they forcing me into making this payment?
- What can I do here? Because I feel like the issue won’t be resolved by the due date and if I don’t pay, they will mark it as a late payment.


I’m not sure if this is the right place to post but any help is appreciated.

238,Advice for Medical Debt,"Hi Reddit community, hope you are all doing well.

First time positing on this page and first time on Reddit overall pretty sure. Just want to start off by saying that I look at this page all the time for finance advice and yall are awesome. Its so great to see people helping each other and often times a comment that took 3 minutes to type out saves months/years of another persons time, savings and so on. Keep it up everyone you all make me proud.

TL:DR - 2-3 questions at that bottom

Now the reason I am here, is to ask for some personal advice (go figure) and I will try and lay out my situation as concisely as I can. If anyone has any experience with this and could point me in the right direction I would be eternally grateful.

So, from the beginning - My appendix ruptured and I was uninsured and am hoping there is anyway to lower it.

\-I graduated from college December 2019, my health insurance was purchased through the school and had paid my premiums with my tuition for 4 years so it became an after thought.

\- 3 months later my appendix ruptured and I didnt have insurance. I did not realize I was uninsured until I woke up from surgery (thankfully nothing worse than a appendectomy led me to this realization)

\-My bill from the hospital was $37,000 - for a 45 min surgery and 15 hours total stay.

\-The hospital discounted it due to no insurance to $15,000

\-I have paid off about $5000 including paying all the the separate bills (anesthesia etc.)

\-So $12,000 left on hospital bill all else has been paid. The hospital sold off an account for $1000 to a collections agency and that $1000 is on my credit report for derogatory account

\-I make payments directly to the hospital, I recently asked them about the amount in collections and they say I can continue to make payments directly to them, however no matter what I pay, it does not effect the $1000 on my credit report.

&#x200B;

If you are still taking time out of your day to read this post...THANK YOU, and I love you.

I end with 3 questions

1. Because the hospital already discounted me from $37,000 to $15,000 and ive paid it down to $12,000 - is there any way to get it lower?
2. is it worth it to contact the collections agency and pay them directly to close the derogatory $1000 account on my credit report? has the damage already been done to my credit report - its 1 of 2 accounts listed and the other is a credit card with a never late payment

I would love nothing more than to pay this sucker off as soon as possible but realistically with what im paid its going to take some time. I also will likey need to get a car loan in the near future which is my main concern for credit report, but priority numero uno is to get this $12,000 bill closed.

I'm projecting the retirement accounts to be at $920k at the end of this year.  If I assume a 4% annual return (which seems fairly conservative) and my planned contributions to the accounts, I project about $1.6M in my brokerage accounts and also about $1.6M in my retirement account at my target retirement age of 52.

I'm projecting $80k in annual expenses for retirement.  So from age 52 to 60 that $80k comes out of my brokerage accounts.  Then from age 60 forward I can start accessing my retirement account as well.  At age 67 I start bringing in social security income.

What the model shows is based on my selected 4% annual investment return, I should be very safe to retire at 52.

What am I missing?  Am I oversimplifying?

Note:  This model ignores the fact that I own an investment property - fully paid off - valued at about $250k that brings in $1800/mo in rent (net of $1300 after accounting for property taxes and insurance).",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0x2ip/my_basic_retirement_planning_model_am_i_really_on/,1615258471.0,5,5,0
240,Stressed Out From First Fulltime Job,"Hi all, I graduated college last year and started my job in Jan 20. So about a year and 3 months in currently. I make 84k/yr, with decent benefits and retirement contributions (5% and increases yearly). However, the job stresses me the hell out. I work in capital project management, there has been a huge uptick in projects, and we are definitely understaffed for the work. I also don't like the work culture in general, a lot of stress is built in the system by design due to different departments having conflicting ""goals"" with others.

Overall I have been thinking about quitting for about 6 months. I have applied passively to other position, but I am not sure if maybe I should just stick it out. I'm not vested in retirement until 4.5 years in. My own contributions are 4% roth 401k and maxing out Roth IRA so I do have something I would keep. I also just bought a condo in August (work paid for closing costs though), and I really do not want to relocate.

Anyways just looking for some advice as I am a little lost. I have been going in circles with this in my head for a while.  And I don't really have anyone to talk to at work about it......its a typical corporate culture, everyone raves how great the company is etc. But I feel like I just don't fit in with it.

245,My parents need our help buying a house. Advice needed.,"Hi I need advice. I live with my husband in Phoenix Arizona and My family lives back in Colorado. My mother has a host of health issues among them severe rheumatoid arthritis and is on oxygen to sleep because she doesn’t get enough oxygen at 7500 feet elevation. My mom has in the past not been great with money but my husband and I have and helping her the last five years to get her shit together and she’s made enormous strides To fix her position financially. 

My mom is not able to qualify for a loan right now because of some delinquencies with medical bills which have been fixed but are not been reflected on her credit report. My mom needs to prove 12 months of On Time payments in order to qualify for a mortgage. They are currently selling their house in Colorado for about $500,000 and they owe $250,000 so they are to make $250,000 on this house. 

My mom is wanting to see if we can buy a house for them with their money and essentially be their landlords so they can get into a house and not have to rent. They are willing to put the profit into our bank account and our control and we will pay the mortgage every month. My mom is most likely going to make me and my husband power of attorney  over her finances. My husband and I will be the ones paying their mortgage on time every month. 

My husband and I have the ability to buy another house but I want to make sure that I’m not going to put our financial security at risk. We both have 800 credit scores, $150,000 income with no debt besides our mortgage ($300000).  My parents make $114000 and have 480 credit score ish. We would sell back to my parents after the year. 

Is this a good idea or will it impact us negatively financially? Is it even legal? I also recommended my mom just rent right now until the market craziness cools down. I think that she’s having FOMO and I don’t want her to buy at the top of the market. Phoenix is having a housing boom right now and I’ve heard there are 50 to 75 offers on each house. I also told her I would cosign on a lease on a house and the money would be in my account and my control so that her rent would be on time but she also could pay the entire year upfront directly to the landlord.

246,The Biggest Credit Card Scam That Nobody is Talking About,"**Update:** This is speculation. What I outline below may not actually be happening. Or, maybe only bits and pieces of it is happening. 

Any marketplace without scalable supervision is dangerous for the customer, and Google Shopping is one of the riskiest of all. Here is a scam I think is unfolding over there:

1. A new, very niche eCommerce site joins Google Shopping, offering one popular product that rarely goes on sale. For example, video game controllers or an Apple product.
2. The site offers a significant discount on the product, upwards of 50% off the market price.
3. Google puts the discounted item at the top of its shopping carousel, so the listing shows up first when the consumer searches for the item. E.g., a consumer searches for ""Nintendo Switch Joy Con"" and Google Shopping shows a list of stores all selling the controller for $79.99. At the top of the list, though, is the new store, selling the controller for $39.99.
4. The consumer clicks on the discounted item and is taken to the eCommerce website.
5. The consumer purchases the item.
6. A few hours after purchasing the product, the consumer receives an email from the website saying that the ""product is out of stock"" and that they will ""receive a refund.""
7. The customer receives a full refund.
8. The eCommerce website does the same thing to thousands of customers, collecting all of their credit card numbers without ever delivering a single product. The store never had the product in the first place. Collecting the credit card numbers was always the goal.
9. The website owners draw small, unnoticeable amounts of money from the credit cards over the following months. (Note: Even if the site is taken down, the original owners can start a new site very quickly and at little cost.)

How can you stop this from happening to you? Well, looking at Reddit reviews doesn't always work. Many of these stores are too new to have any buzz. If you search the company, you may find threads saying things like, ""They seem legit, but unfortunately, they were sold out of what I wanted.""

If you look them up on scam watch boards, you may see something like, ""We have not collected any information about this website."" Conducting a WHOIS lookup will offer little information, as well, whether it's a legitimate site or not.

**My best suggestion is to follow the adage that if the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.**

The pressure to determine the eCommerce site's legitimacy shouldn't rest on the consumer alone. These big marketplaces have a responsibility here. Companies like Google need to invest more into data science tools that can catch this type of fraud. In the meantime, I hope my warning helps you avoid this scam.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m1ctu9/the_biggest_credit_card_scam_that_nobody_is/,1615314544.0,0,0,0

248,[Update] Mom passed away and held all the cards,"Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lxibny/need_advice_mom_passed_away_and_held_all_the_cards/

TL;DR near the bottom

Firstly, I want to say thank you to all of those that sent their condolences and advice in that thread. My wife and I are truly appreciative and in awe of everyone who took a little bit of time to offer those things to us.

Along with expressing our gratitude, I wanted to ask another question. My mother had 2 primary bank accounts. One account was a joint checking with my father, the other was a checking account with only her name on it. At this time, I do not know if my dad was designated as a beneficiary which leads to my question. 

Because of the timing of my mom's passing, the mortgage and other bills were due and unpaid. I have my mom's laptop and signed into her banking account to move money to the joint account in order to cover those few bills. Those are the only transactions I've initiated. My question is by doing this, have I caused a headache for myself/dad in the near future? From what I understand, if there is no beneficiary, this account will need to go through probate. I'm hoping I didn't goof but wanted to seek some advice as there rare more bills coming due in the next few days and I will need to do the same thing.


**TL;DR Should I/my dad stop using my mom's checking? Should we consult legal council?**

And to give an update about both my mother and father-in-law, for anyone who might be curious, my mother had 2 small life insurance policies through work so a lot of my dad's debts should be taken care of in a couple of months. My father-in-law has had his breathing tube removed and is awake and coherent and even got to spend time with his wife today so good news on both fronts.

I'm fairly certain I will have enough annual income to max the Employee portion by the end of this year. I'm estimating my net annual income to be around $80,000 to $100,000. Initially and without much research I thought I had the brilliant idea that it would be a good idea to front load my solo 401k. I got sucked into the whole notion of ""time in the market>timing the market""... 

Error #1 (I think?). I withdrew $29,500 from a taxable account and transferred it to my solo 401k. I'm maxing out the $19,500 Employee portion and arbitrarily put $10,000 in as the Employer contribution. Going back and doing the math on the federal worksheet, I think I'll be OK at the end of the year (if I make my planned amount) since I won't have over contributed. Based on $80k net income, I think I have an extra \~$4,800 I could contribute as the Employer. 

My questions are:

Can I do what I just did? I technically haven't earned $29,500 yet but will later. 

Do I have to pay **Hawaii state** estimated taxes if my Q1 income is $0 since I'm saying 100% of my salary is going to my solo 401k? 

Do I have to pay Federal estimated tax for Q1?

I'm under contract to buy a house (woohoo!) and recently needed to wire money to the title company to cover earnest money. Cool, put it in the first night I was under contract, and my bank (an investment bank) sent it out the next day. We called and confirmed the wire information with the title company during this, adding the escrow agent's name, address of property, correct routing/account numbers etc. Three days later when the earnest money was due, the wire was marked as sent/completed with my bank, but the title company still hadn't received it. Cue me driving like a maniac to hand deliver checks to the title company, and confirming with my escrow agent that he would reject the wire when it came in.

So, I call my bank, asking what the heck is going on. After some back and forth over a few calls they confirmed that the funds had left their possession and were with the intermediary bank they use. I request they trace the wire and I get a callback a few hours later. The funds are on hold with the intermediary bank for compliance as per federal requirements(?), and are requesting additional information that I included on the wire. Namely, the information for our escrow agent with the title company I listed on the wire, including DOB, full name, and his address. My smooth brain thinks its a scam, but the security questions my bank uses and the phone number they called on were legitimate.

I've already contacted the escrow agent with the title company about this but they haven't gotten back to me. I'm having trouble finding any information about this online, or any similar examples.

I get paperless bank and credit card statements, like most people. I've never thought about downloading them because I assumed they would always be available online if I ever needed them.

Well, I'm having a state tax audit right now going back to January 2017. One checking account I used during this time was closed in 2018 and they're unable to retrieve my statements for the first half of 2017. One of the credit cards I used during this period charges $5 per statement, and they only have statements available online going back one year. So that's $5 for each month of 2017, 2018 & 2019. On top of that they will only offer to mail them, which takes a VERY long time these days. It could cost me around $10,000 if I can't prove I spent money on what I claimed to spend it on.

To avoid this entire situation all I had to do was buy a little external hard drive for a few dollars and take a few minutes every month to download all my statements onto it.

264,Am I getting scammed? Australian Car Insurance Question,"Hey team, looking for some guidance from fellow Australians here. 

Last week, I backed up into another car in the parking lot. There was barely a scratch because I’d done it so slow, but I believe in karma and left a note with my first name and phone number. I took photos of the scratch, too. 

The next day, the owner of the car texts me. English is his first language, so he said he would get his ‘car manager’ to call me at 4pm on the Friday after he’d gotten the scratch assessed at the repair place. I asked what he meant by ‘car manager’, but he ignored my texts going forward. I didn’t give him ANY other details besides my first name and my phone number. 

On the Friday, I get a call from someone in relation to the scratch. They’re from a company I don’t recognise. They ask me if I have insurance and whether I’ve made a claim yet, to which I answered no. I said I was waiting for a quote on the scratch’s repair since it was so small and would be happy to pay for it if it came under my insurance’s excess. 

This is where it gets funky. 

This guy claims that my insurance company (NRMA) will refund the excess if the repairs come in under the standard fee. Also, I asked him what the quote was for the scratch repair and he told me he couldn’t give it to me. He said it would be in my best interest to make a claim and he would send all the necessary information to them after I’d done so. Now I (26 f) know jack all about insurance, but that seemed unlike an insurance company to do. 

After he’d said he would forward the documentation to my insurer, I asked him ‘wait, don’t you need my last name?’ to which he read out my last name and my address. That startled me a little as I didn’t know how he would have had access to that. Anyways, he told me he’d ring me back on Tuesday and see how the claim was progressing. 

I called NRMA after that to double check everything this guy said. They said a) he lied and they definitely do NOT refund any of the excess if repairs cost less than the standard excess fee, and b) he should NOT have had access to my address and they don’t know how he got it, especially since he didn’t work for NRMA. Going off my first name and mobile, only NRMA and the government should have legal access to it. 

I made the decision that next time he called, I would let it go to voicemail and listen to the message and try and deduce his name and company again. He called me today and I let it ring out but he didn’t leave a voicemail. He then called on a mobile and didn’t leave one either. 

I googled the phone numbers and a very dodgy insurance website came up that was, like, half way down the google page. Other reports were of scam calls. 

Am I getting scammed here? Is any of this legal? What’s the go lol

We are generally well prepared and prepped financially a lot before conceiving but I am now trying to figure out what legal documents we should have in place. I’ve begun contacting lawyers to get estimates on Wills, AMDs, and Power of Attorneys. Going into this, I really had never heard of a trust except as something children with rich parents had. I now realize it’s a standard estate planning tool. Most lawyers I’ve contacted seem to be pushing for it rather than just a Will. But I can’t tell if that’s because it’s actually much better, or because it’s way more expensive. I get that the main benefit is that a trust does not have to go through probate and a Will does. My husband and I are both young and healthy, and just looking to have things set up for our child. Can anyone tell me if shelling out $3k to establish a trust at this point in our lives is really advisable?

Sorry to have another post about this, but despite my attempt to use the Google sheet floating around and reading other HDHP with HSA vs PPO posts, I still can't figure this out for me. Also not sure if I included all the relevant info. Thanks in advance for help!

Health wise, I'm also not sure if I'm healthy enough despite being in my 20s where a HDHP makes sense? My last job was a PPO but I didn't pay anything out of my paycheck so it was easy to not think about. I have a neurological issue that sometimes flares up and would require a few visits with my primary care doctor. Also have an rx for ADHD meds and with my last insurance, saw my primary care doctor monthly and psychiatrist every other month to check up on ADHD related things (sleep, nutrition, etc). Also I'm pretty active fitness wise and no incidents last year, but two years ago had a stress fracture in my foot, messed up a toe from overtraining and then my knee got out of whack while in a fitness class (but before and after that year, no accidents or injuries since I was a teen). So all that in mind, it's very possible I could go to doctors or specialists minimally in a year (I don't particularly need the ADHD visits) or I could just get unlucky and have more medical needs than expected, it's hard to predict.

These are listed as installment accounts in my credit reports.  Aside from student loans, my credit builder loan is the only installment account I have.

My only open accounts are student loan accounts (paying as agreed) and  Va education accounts (in collections).  All other deliquent accounts are closed.

282,Hardship Withdrawal Question,"Hi there!

So - I adjunct teach on the side and have a super tiny 401k with that (Basically, what I'm saying is that it's not my ""real"" 401k -- which is tied to my actual, full time job). Anyway, my husband was a couple of credit hours away from his degree, so we took a hardship withdrawal from the 401K back in August 2019 to use for educational expenses in the Spring semester (Spring 2020 - May). Unfortunately, he's had pretty bad congestive heart failure that flares up periodically, and starting around Feb/March 2020, he started having symptoms (water retention -- like 80 lbs of water weight). He also has Atrial Fibrillation, and unfortunatley this resulted in a stroke in May 2020. After this happened it was a downward spiral of dealing with him relearning to talk/walk/eat/get a feeding tube put into his stomach, and then taken out, yada yada).

He's doing much better now (physically; not cognitively), and obviously that put a damper on enrolling for those May 2020 courses. Now I'm sitting down and trying to handle paperwork and random stuff that I've kind of blown off for the past 9 months, and so my question is -- should I alert the IRS that I didn't use this hardship withdrawal as we orgnally planned? (I think it as like 1200 bucks or something)? Or should I contact my adjunct plan's administrator? Or should I just let it go?

I worry about this randomly and want to make sure I'm paying the correct taxes and penalties, or giving this amount ""back"" to the 401k (which I'm not sure is possible), if I need to.

285,Understanding a lien while refinancing,"Hi, I'm looking for a little guidance/explanation as I am in the middle of refinancing.

&#x200B;

Quick background: I bought my townhouse in Aug. 2018 with a grant of $7,500 from the state of Illinois as a first time homebuyer. When I took the lien I understood that if I moved within five years of purchase that I would have to pay back a pro-rated amount on the grant. A couple months later I received a Certificate of Exemption saying ""This property is located within the program area and the transaction is exempt from the requirements of 765 ILCS 77/70 et seq. because the application was taken by an exempt entity"". I kind of thought it meant I was off the hook from having to pay any of it back, but it wasn't a big deal at the time so I just filed the paper away.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now. I am in the process of refinancing. At one point the company I am working with asked for documentation regarding the release of the lien. I scanned and forwarded the document. Today I received this message. ""Please clarify your intention of keeping open or closing the lien of $7,500.00 with Illinois Housing Development Authority. This will either need to be be paid at close or subordinated."" Does this mean I am still on the hook for this money and I will have to pay the rest of the lien or add it to the mortgage? By my math it should only be about half left since I've been living here two and a half years. At the end of the day I won't cry about an extra \~$3,500 added to the final bill as my mortgage will still be lower. I just want to make sure I'm not missing something obvious that can save me money.

286,Need help to figure out my options,"I've recently gotten a promotion at work and a small raise that went with it. I work as an independent contractor so my annual salary depends on the number of days worked in a given year. If I take 2020 as an example on how many days I'll be working then the raise comes out to about an extra 3000 (after taxes) per year.

Now, I'm doing my best to be a financially responsible adult, I have my budget in place and I'd say I know exactly where 95% of my money goes every month (I use about 5% as a tolerance for any unexpected expenses). I have a very moderate amount of debt (well managed, but I'll get to this later). I'm also someone who's saving up to buy a house so there's that as well.

In terms of outstanding debt:

Car PCP - 200 per month (with a balloon payment of about 7300 due in 14 months) - I'm on schedule to have this covered and fully paid off when due. Interest on this is roughly 4%

Portfolio margin - I put about 700 per month towards paying off the margin (5300 outstanding, roughly 4% interest, on track to be paid off by October)

Two Credit cards - I fully pay these off when they're due and I don't carry a balance nor pay any interest

In terms of my options:

* I could put this money down towards general savings (this account doesn't pay any interest) but I use it to save up for all of my annual (and my bi-monthly) bills and any other predictable expenses
* I could put this money down towards my mortgage savings (barely any interest) but I could reach my savings goal 2 months earlier (my rent is very reasonable so this wouldn't make much of a difference in terms of savings)
* I could put this money towards paying off my margin (again, it would make difference of about 2 months), not much saved in payed interest
* I could put this money into my portfolio and invest it (I'm not buying anything at the moment as I'm trying to reduce my margin). I suppose this way I could still pay off my margin in time but also avail of some of the investment opportunities at the moment
* Any other suggestions?

I'm trying to decide what would be the best way to use this extra money and not fall for lifestyle inflation like I have in the past. My budget at the moment allows me to live a life at a fairly decent standard, so I don't feel like I need to spend any extra money on things that I don't need.

Last September a 25,000 pound, 100-year old Live Oak fell on my house from a hurricane, causing structural damage to the tune of $50k+. 

Luckily, insurance is covering repairs, but they aren't covering the $10,500 it cost to remove the fell tree. 

I've been looking at HELOCs and Home Equity Loans. I have about $50k in equity in my home and other than my mortgage, no debt. 

If I'm having to spend $10k (and maybe more on home repairs), would you recommend either option? 

Alternatively, if I have to spend a large amount of money, ideally I'd like to maximize any kind of credit card promotional offers (sign-ups bonuses, 0% intro purchases or 0% BTs). 

Has anyone had experience utilizing credit cards when dealing with insurance settlement money? Any potential red flags or landmines to look out for? 

Any benefit to using HELOCs or HELs over credit cards?

293,[NY] Debt collection attempt against LLC that has been dissolved,"My family owned a small business which was forced to close last year due to COVID. The LLC has been dissolved with the state of NY and all assets have been disposed. All bank accounts are closed, final tax returns filed, etc. The business no longer exists.

Our commercial insurance carrier tried to bill us last year for the annual premium and we told them that the business was closing, and I thought that was the end of it. But now they're claiming that we never filed the proper form. They've sent a bill (for the premium on a policy that we didn't use, need, or want) to a collection agency who sent a certified letter to the business address. The new tenant signed for it and sent it to me.

Any advice on how to respond? Should I contact the collection agency and provide documentation that the business has been dissolved, or just ignore it? I'd rather not have this hanging out there, but I'm concerned that by responding at all, the debt could somehow attach to me personally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0n2uy/ny_debt_collection_attempt_against_llc_that_has/,1615229970.0,12,12,0

I was referred to this hospital by my other clinic/General surgeon I was seeing, so I'm assuming he's contracted out through them.

This surgery was done 2/16, and the claim was approved 2/24. But today I received a bill from the clinic saying I owe the $276.80. 

I'm confused on this. Does the hospital not pay them out that portion since I paid 1383.20?

I bought my home at $440k. In august. It was a decent fixer upper we spruced well

Due to the wild relocation market. My current market cake is between 680-780k.

My main problem (I think) is simply the amount of debt that I have. I make my payments on time, pay more than the minimum, and have some variety of debt - I have one installment loan (a car payment). Other than that, I have student loans (which I'm current on, and working towards public service loan forgiveness, fingers crossed) and way too much credit card debt.

I'm thinking of getting a personal loan to pay off my credit cards in order to improve my debt to credit ratio. I'd want to make sure the interest rate is not too high, but before contacting any lenders I'm trying to figure out if it's even a good idea.

It seems to me that if I pay off my credit cards my score should increase and make it easier to get better rates for a mortgage - I'd have the same amount of debt, but have more credit available (understanding that I wouldn't be using my cards and stacking up more debt). But I'm not sure the impact of taking on a second installment loan - either on my credit score, or on how mortgage lenders would see that. Any insights would be great!

308,"Mom filed bankruptcy, my money got seized instead?","So my mom filed for bankruptcy and my checking account money got completely seized by the bank. Basically, I'm 21 now but back when I was a still a minor, I created a joint account under my mom's name and never created a new one once I became of age.

Years later, my mom's name is still under that account but she's never touched that money. The bank assumed that this was her money or that she shared it with me,, and claimed that  this money is now property of the bankruptcy estate. 

This is an excerpt from the letter:

""Wells Fargo is required by operations of Section 541 and 542 of the Bankruptcy Code to act in good faith to preserve the estate funds and must follow the trustee's direction with regard to estate funds. Accordingly, Wells Fargo has asked for direction from the trustee. As you are aware, the trustee has 30 days from the First Meeting of Creditors to object to a claim of exception for the estate funds. Ownership of claimed exempt property remains with the bankruptcy estate until such time, or the trustee directs otherwise.""

I have no idea what to do next. My mom's court date is next month and I don't know how we're going to prove that my mom has nothing to do with this money other than with bank statements.

Will I get my money back?

Edit: I'm a bit confused about whether my account got actually liquidated yet or it's just held as a bankruptcy estate. If so, the trustee shouldn't be allowed to liquidate it as a majority of that money comes from my student loans and grants, which I heard is automatically considered exempt.

Given these terms, what is the better option?

HSA: $1500 deductible

HRA: $2000 deductible \*Employer refunds up to $2000 spent towards the deductible

All other factors the same - same insurance network, out of pocket limit, copays. 

The Employee Monthly Rate deducted from my paycheck is $184 under both HSA and HRA. I cannot tell if the employer contributes any amount towards either plan.

&#x200B;

However, am I understanding this correctly? :

under the HSA, I end up paying $2208 (184\*12) per year towards my health insurance costs. My employer 'generously' refunds me up to $2000 of that - if I spend $1000 on drs visits that will be covered.

under the HSA, I would pay $2208 - but if I only spend $1000 on drs visit this year, the remainder would be **mine to keep**

I am 33, married with 1 child, make about $50,000 year. No personal debts other than our mortgage. This is where my personal accounts currently stand. My husband also has a 401k, Roth IRA, mutual funds, etc and makes about $100k/yr so I feel good with our overall savings...I am just curious about my investment selections...I'm thinking I could probably move some stuff around to reduce my fees since some of these funds have ERs of .75 or so.

With Schwab I have 64,000 invested. 
-45,250 of that is in mutual funds
        -26% LGILX
        -27% FUNYX
        -33% SWTSX
        -14% PRBLX
And the other $18,750 is in a Roth account that is in the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio program (my balance is 64% stocks, 25% fixed income, 2% commodities, and  9% cash)

With Fidelity I have about $2000 in random stocks

At Principal I have my 401k and it’s currently valued at 66,702 (I do an 8% contribution and have a 5% employer match). Our plan now allows for Roth 401k elections so I’ve recently opted into that. My breakdown is as follows:  
-15% Pimco Total Return Instl Fund (low risk)
-25% Vanguard 2050 Target Fund (mid risk)
-35% TRowe Small Cap I Fund (higher risk)
-25% AmFunds R6 Fund (high risk)

I have some inheritance that I’d also like to get invested into my mutual fund account since I’ve maxed out the Roth account for 2020 and 2021. I have about $70,000 that is liquid and just parked in checking and savings accounts.

So, million dollar question....where am I falling short? Put more money in the lower fee funds like SWTSX? Get more exposure in the international markets? What else?

I feel very stuck in my situation I have a psychology degree and unless I go back to school or switch fields I will be making no money. I am just not sure if I'm ready to go back. School is hard and I don't feel that I have the experience yet.  I also don't want to live with my parents for another 4 years and I'm pretty sure they are done with me living with them.  This doesn't even consider the cost of such a degree.

I am scared if I choose not to go back and move out I'll be living paycheck to paycheck stuck in a cycle. I drive an hour to work everyday and I hate it, I feel like I have no time. I thought about moving closer to my work but the area I live in is very expensive and if I tried to live on my salary It would be difficult even with roomates. I thought about moving to a cheaper city like philadelphia but I worry about the crime and my safety.

321,"Starting an IRA, ETFs or Indices?","As  a new joiner to the workforce and someone who has already started  contributing to a 401k, I have  been heavily recommended to start a Roth  IRA. I currently have an account with Robinhood where I hold a few select stocks but it is mostly ETFs that I intended to hold for long-term growth. As for my IRA, I have created a profile with vanguard  but have bought nothing as of yet. So now, my questions.

1. Just want to confirm that starting an IRA is the right decision.
2. I can transfer over my ETFs to my new vanguard account but should I? Suppose I want to invest in an ETF more speculation than long-term growth, but would still be held for at least 6 months, that should be done outside of my IRA? Or take the S&P500 for example, I currently have vanguard S&P500 ETF, does it make sense to even buy an S&P 500 index? If do, does it make sense to hold both the ETF and the Index? Should I sell the ETF at some point?

325,Tips for developing a healthy relationship with money,"Hi PF, 

First of all, I want to say thanks to the community- I’ve learned a lot from you guys and think this sub is a great resource.

Slightly different topic than I’ve seen discussed here, so if it’s better suited for somewhere else, please let me know.

I’m a 28 year old that’s single, no kids, no debt, living in CA. I started working a few years ago and I’ve got a job making decent money and I meticulously track every expense through spreadsheets, analyzing everything. In 2020 I saved 65% of my pay (maxed out 401k, threw a bunch in the stock market). I like working, and don’t see myself wanting to retire in 5 years. My net worth is currently ~2x my gross salary. I recently realized that I’m in a good spot, and I don’t need to be so hard on myself financially, but I really struggle to let myself spend money on additional money on things that might bring me happiness.

I’m not sure if it’s because I track everything so much, but spending money is very stressful for me, even though I’ve got a budget I stick to. I don’t mind rent, food, other necessities, but I find myself over analyzing every non-essential purchase and asking myself about the value proposition. I consider purchases (outdoors equipment, trips, etc) for months and never pull the trigger, debating how much incremental happiness they will bring to me. I lose sleep researching products I don’t ever buy. I don’t turn my heat on unless I have company over. I feel like a weird combination of a frugal obsessive and a slimy consumption machine spending so much of my waking time looking at what I need next. Many of the purchases I’ve made in the past bring my happiness, and I love them, but some I feel were a mistake, and I feel like those have left an awful taste in my mouth. 

I want to develop a better relationship with money. I’m open to all suggestions.

I'd like to do a backdoor Roth conversion in Vanguard (there's actually a button for this in my Traditional IRA account? 'Convert to Roth IRA?' Is this correct?). Currently have a Traditional IRA which I made post-tax 2020 and 2021 max contributions into. However, this Trad IRA also has a few contributions I made around 5-10 years ago, before I knew what I was doing and knew that I could put in a few thousand every year for tax deductions. For simplicity's sake, it's about $6k old pre-tax contributions and $12k post-tax. Every ""tutorial"" I've seen online tells you to convert the entire thing, as long as there are no tax-advantaged amounts.

I opened a new checking account with Bank of America in January 2021. I deposited $294.47 on 2/28/2021 into my account via Direct Deposit. My account was in good standing. On 2/28/2021 at 4:29PM I deposited $1400.00 (Seventy $20 Bills) into Bank of Americas ATM. Which malfunctioned and was unable to fund my account or return my deposit. It asked me the amount and also gave me a receipt of the machine malfunction. I stayed at the bank and within 15 minutes I filed a claim via the Electronic Claims number provided. The claims representative informed me I would receive a temporary credit within 2 days pending an investigation and notice via mail. 

I attempted to use my ATM/Debit card to make a purchase the next day and it was declined. I contacted Bank of America and was informed my account was in the process of closure pending the result of the previously opened claim. They never contacted me informing my account was in closure. On 3/8/2021 I contacted Bank of America for an update due to not having access to online banking message center. I did not receive any mail notice. 

Bank of America informed me the claim was denied as they were unable to retrieve any cash from the ATM and stated they had video footage which showed I did not make a cash deposit which is impossible. I asked for proof of the video footage and Bank of America informed me I can file a police report and subpoena the footage. Later another representative said the reason on the letter was that they didnt find cash, nothing about video footage? Why should I be put through more emotional anguish by opening a legal process to rectify a malfunction with Bank of Americas faulty ATM machine.  I asked the representative when my remaining account balance would be sent to me and she informed me the estimated account closure date was April 12th, 2021. How is this possible when I was informed if my claim was accepted I would be sent a check including my account balance that week. Meanwhile I lose $1400 and my remaining funds will be held for more than month by Bank of America.

I attached the ATM malfunction receipt and proof of my ability to provide the funds I received and deposited. The funds I deposited were Federal Unemployment Compensation due to unemployment because of Covid-19. I am a US Military Veteran and this has severely impacted my already handicapped ability to provide for myself and fulfill my obligation to my rent. I cannot easily replace $1400 at this time due to unemployment. I think it is unacceptable Bank of America is allowed to operate claims and accounts in this way.

336,Should I confront my boss about switching me from 1099-NEC to W-2?,"Hello great people!

I will try to keep this short. Since May 2020 I have worked for a small, family owned bicycle shop. They hired me and my boyfriend as 1099 workers. This of course resulted in me having to pay over 10% of income in self-employment taxes. This was a lot considering I didn't even make enough to have to pay federal income taxes.

To note, in the decade they have been in business, they supposedly have never hired any actual employees besides themselves (two family members). They have pretty much only hired contracted mechanics and short-term laborers. I believe this is why we were hired as 1099. I don't think my boss knew how long we were going to work. He certainly did not expect an insane surge in sales due to covid requiring us to work through the Fall, and I also don't think he expected our dedication and work ethic.

It's about time for us to come back to work after our winter hiatus. I would really like to avoid paying self-employment tax again because, well *I'm clearly not self employed.* I show up to a set workplace on a set schedule, I am paid by the hour, and I use employer-provided tools, etc (I believe this is sufficient enough evidence yeah?), so I'm hoping I can talk to my boss soon about switching us to W-2 employees. This is worth it right? 

It's a super small business, so I don't believe any benefits will be offered. I'm turning 26 this year so I will have to get my own health insurance. I read that you can get reimbursed for your health insurance as a 1099 worker, that's why I'm bringing it up. 

A final note; we have created a really great relationship with the two owners. I really feel like I'm family. They closed the shop down for a week last year owing to a covid scare, and they still paid us for the week. They also gave us a $200 year-end bonus (which of course doesn't sound like a lot but it made me feel so valued and appreciated), and they paid my boyfriend time and a half for overtime throughout the year (I never worked enough to qualify). They definitely treat us well. They really really wanted us to come back to work this year, so I know they value us as employees, and I absolutely adore working there. I am excited to go to work every day for real. I want to keep working there, I just want things to be fair, and I don't want to set the wrong tone by confronting my boss about this issue.

Thanks for any advice. 

**TL;DR- I was hired as a 1099 worker last year, but am hoping to confront my boss about switching to W-2 this year. Worth it?**

338,I’m 29 and am confused about retirement income calculations.,"So my confusion is- my income has changed (increased) somewhat significantly through my 20’s. Depending on which calculator I look at I’m either way behind or ok with retirement. I don’t have any loans and just started a Roth IRA with much less than the limit last year.

I’m saving towards a house down payment as well and have savings that would cover 4-6 months of expenses if I got laid off.

Right now I’m putting 5% of my income in a Roth 401k and my employer matches that fully. So 10% of my income (including bonus etc) is going into my 401k. Apart from figuring out a detailed budget to increase and better my general savings rate, would I be better off investing in the stock market at this point rather than putting away an additional 5% or possibly $6K per year into a Roth IRA?

I have investments in stocks, primarily in a large cap mutual fund.

I’m wondering if I’m better off aiming for 15% and possibly maximizing IRA’s 6 years from now when I’m 35, but putting more into stocks (ETFs and mutual funds) at this point since I can technically afford to take losses and recover from them at this point in my life and career.

What income benchmark do you generally use when calculating retirement income? And how do you decide between Roth and traditional contributions? I only recently realized that I might be losing out on the company match by choosing Roth because the match is by dollars I contribute but that matched money is on a traditional basis and not Roth?

1. we sold our house and bought a fifth wheel. We owe ~$50k on the fifth wheel at 7.57%

2. We paid off all our credit card debt. 

3. We have just under $5k left on our car loan at 2.28%

4. I owe about $1800 on student loans but the interest isn’t accruing and no payments are due until september, if they don’t cancel the debt by then. 

5. We have a van that’s paid off with 202k miles and issues are starting to show up but nothing severe yet. 

6. my wife works virtually as a teacher for now and I’m a SAHD so one car with no issue and one car that just drives is an ok set up for now. 

7. We have about $100k in the bank from the home sale after all is said and done and we should have about $2k left over a month after our budget is dealt with. 

8. Our goal is to buy land  and build a wheelchair accessible home for our son who will be in a wheelchair, in all likelihood, in the next 3-5 years. 

9. Whenever he goes into a chair we’ll need a wheelchair van. 

Ok, all that said... what do I do? Is there somewhere I can put the $100k better than a savings account that I can still access if we find land in a few weeks or a few months?

What’s my best bet for flexibility but also using wisdom and having the money do something positive in the meantime?

349,19 year old seeking financial advice regarding 529,"Hey guys! First time in this subreddit, trying to get a healthier relationship with finance in general because I figure if I do it now, I'll save a lot of annoyance later down the line. This question is more specific though and has to deal with my 529 plan that my grandfather left me.

I moved into a city with some friends of mine with the idea that I'd take classes and use my 529 money to pay for rent, and it went great the first semester as I was able to stay on top of my coursework. This semester, however, I am taking 2 classes, equalling 6 credits, which is the minimum I need to use my 529 without extraneous fees. I also picked up a job, and I also have ADHD, and that formula has lead to me having a harder time this semester allocating time to my classes. I've stayed on top of one of them, but I did not anticipate how difficult my other class would be and I've fallen way behind on coursework- I don't think I can pass. I don't want to have a failing grade on my transcript but I also don't know if I can drop the class and continue getting 529 money, which I rely on for rent and utilities.

&#x200B;

Any advice would be insanely appreciated, really stressed about this right now.

&#x200B;

Thanks !

EDIT: For the record, the second class is a piano class and it's going at way too fast of a rate for me to catch up, I don't think I fully thought through taking it. I am planning on going to a city college next fall, but I didn't want to waste the money while the classes are all online.

354,Use contributions from Roth to pay for child education expenses instead of opening a 529? Have access to 403(b).,"Hi,

I am expecting my first child and was going through setting up savings for my child. The common answer seems to be setting up a 529 for each child that can be used for qualified education expenses. However if they don't use all the money, or go to college, then you take a 10% penalty and pay taxes on the earning.

That got me think about my Roth IRA. Currently my spouse and I max out our IRAs every year. That max out price, along with our retirement funds from work, should give me a good healthy amount for retirement (LOCL area). I am opening up a 403(b) through work which will allow to make additional retirement contributions. My thought was to make sure I put in at least that 6k in my 403(b) to replace any money potentially taken from the Roth. Then I could withdraw contributions only from the Roth with no penalties. I was hoping to put around $1k a year in the 529 so would then just offer something like 25-30k for their school expenses.

Has anyone here done this? Do you find it fair to essentially take the market returns from what would be in their 529? Are there any negatives here?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0xecy/use_contributions_from_roth_to_pay_for_child/,1615259569.0,1,1,0

356,Starting the process of buying... maybe,"My husband (30M) and I (33F) moved in with my parents to save up a down payment for our first home. We have been here since July, and have an agreement to be here until Jan 2022 at least. We estimated it would take us that long to save up between 10% and 15% for our down payment. We currently have $12,000 saved, and would like to have $25,000 saved at minimum before we start looking. We currently have about $4,000 in debt that has recently accumulated from emergencies, and about $4,000 in our emergency fund. We are hoping to find a house between $250,000 and $300,000 in the suburbs of Austin (north - Round rock, Cedar Park, Leander).

The main concern at this point is the market. Austin is obviously booming right now, and we are afraid that if we wait too long, we will be priced out of even the outskirts where we are currently looking. I am uncomfortable getting a mortgage while having any debt and not having a substantial emergency fund.

The question I came here to ask, which you wouldn't be able to tell by my rambling above, is this:

When do I start trying to get pre-approved for a mortgage? Do I wait until right before we start seriously looking for a house? If I try now, and we dont end up buying until next year, what will that do to our credit?

Any other advice would be helpful. I am reading as much as I can about mortgages and such, but having never done this before, I feel a bit lost.

357,I need help with my debt to buy a home,"Hello all,
I want help running through my financial situation regarding my debt and my hopes to buy a home soon. 

Little backstory. Right now I’m engaged to my GF and we have two kids together (3 year old and 6 month old). She only works part time and doesn’t make much money but that means we don’t pay for child care. I work full time as a truck driver. Home every day though which is nice. They pay me $300 a day not matter how long or short the day is and I work 5 days a week. I take home a little more that 1k after taxes weekly. 78k a year.

We live at my fiancé’s parents house in a separate home on the property. They charge me $700 in rent which is great for where we live (Portland Or) 

Last few years I went to a trade school and actively trying to break into that work here regionally but it’s harder than I though (power lineman). During that that I got myself into debt trying to provide a good life for my family and keep up with everything. 

Right now my portfolio looks like this

Wells Fargo: 
CC is $6843 at 11.15% with a minimum payment of $134 and limit is $9500

LOC is $2033 at 19.25% with a minimum payment of $60 and limit is $3000

PL $3585 at 17.49% with a minimum payment of $146

OnPoint CU: 
CC $11,699 with a minimum payment of $234 and a limit of 13,650. It’s at 12.9% but $6892 is at 1.99% till January 2022.

I also have a car loan with a balance of $1800 at 3.9% and min payment of $126 and a god damn 30k sallie Mae student loan at god knows what interest rate and I pay about $450 a month on that.

Really want to buy a home soon because we are really outgrowing this small home we are in. I am pretty frugal and always pay more than the minimum.

I have no missed payments or derogatory marks but the credit utilization is holding my credit score back at like 690 according to credit Karma

I have 5k saved up just sitting in savings that I really don’t want to touch until it helps put me into a home.

Talked to a mortgage specialist at my local credit union about their first time home buyer program that allows no money down and you can wrap closing costs into your loan but they also won’t charge you mortgage insurance.

What do you think my best plan of action is? I’ve been trying to snowball it. Still pay more than minimum on all payments but all extra is going to the Wells Fargo line of credit. Unfortunately my two most maxed out cards have the lowest interest rate so I’m avoiding paying those off and but I know that’s hurting my credit.

Thought about throwing all that in one loan that says pre approved. Higher interest rates than some of my debt but lower than others. Can still pay more than that minimum payment and will help credit utilization. My concern is if I pay that Down and go for a home in 6 months I may hurt my approval amount. The debt balance will be down but the monthly payment will still be high compared to if I was just paying each account individually and my minimums would be lower because the balances are going down. I suppose I could refinance that loan but it
Would be another credit hit.

Advice on next steps?,"Hi all, not new to the investing sphere, (already have a substantial amount of my NW invested in the stock market with my allocation of roughly 75/25 VTI/VXUS). Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons. Recently, I experienced a sudden windfall as one of our relatives unfortunately passed away. Around this time, it was revealed to me that I would be the partial beneficiary of his sizable fortune in bitcoin.

&#x200B;

I won't be disclosing the amount of bitcoin, however, suffice to say that it is roughly equal to my stock portfolio in $USD value. I'm curious what the community thinks I should do with said bitcoin. My options are to either:

A. Sell all the bitcoin (and pay taxes?) and convert proceeds to more VTI/VXUS.

B. Hold the bitcoin as it seems to be gaining ground as an institutional grade asset.

Arguments for selling:

Bitcoin is extremely volatile. It has experienced multiple 80% drawdowns in its past. The stock market is proven to average 7-8% returns annually and has much less severe drawdowns during bear markets. Nonzero possibility for bitcoin to eventually go to zero.

Arguments for holding:

Ability to gain 8% interest on Bitcoin (however not FDIC/SIPC insured). Ability to take loans using bitcoin as collateral and avoid ever having to sell. Avoid paying taxes? Due to limited supply cap, has the potential for large gains in the current macroeconomic climate of inflation, especially if it fulfills its investment thesis as digital gold. 

I am mid 30s, 250k combined average income, married, no children/future plans to have any, homeowner. Never sold any assets, so I'm going in this with the mindset of building real wealth to eventually FIRE.

Also posted to r/studentloans but looking for broader perspective. Does it make a difference that I can put that ""windfall"" into a 529 to conservatively track the market (tax-free) until I need the money in 9-12 months?

Here is the thing, it would be REALLY nice if we could use that $10,000 towards other stuff we would like. I'm thinking about rolling the closing costs into the cost of the loan, it would increase the total cost from $310k to $320k and would be an extra $4.5k interest over the course of the 30 year loan. Just hearing those facts alone, I think I'm crazy even thinking about... almost 50% interest.

Here is where I'm confused. The Fed tries to keep inflation at 2% each year, so each year I'd be paying the loan with money that is worth more and more. That $4.5k interest would be a lot less in todays numbers and might actually worth doing. I also have the thought that people have been rolling closing costs into their home loan for decades at much higher interest rates... so if there was \*ever\* a time to roll costs, it would be now with the lower rate.

I'm 27. I just paid off all my active credit card debt and my credit score improved from 486 to 561. My remaining debts are derogatory (old credit cards and medical debt) and federal student loans. I'm in a fully funded PhD program, so those are deferred until 2025-ish. However, I owe about $70k in student loans--all federal, no private.

I know derogatory accounts drop off after 7 years, but internet info on how to handle them is confusing. I believe they are not collecting interest. Here are the debts:

7 months old: $181, collection/chargeoff

9 months old: $528, collection/chargeoff

16 months old: $1002 collection/chargeoff

4 years old: $0 (fully paid down but not dropped from account yet)

I make about $31k a year. So does my partner but she's got a lot of debt herself. However, her credit score is in the high 600s. In about 5 years, we're hoping to start a family, so we want to improve our credit by then.

I’m covered by my parents health and dental insurance until I’m 26 so I don’t have to worry about this.

407,Process of renting a home for college (Asking for help),"Hey hey so basically me and some friends are looking at homes online to rent for college. What is the exact process we have to go through for renting a home and what are the all the costs we will have to pay? Here are some questions I have:   


If my move in date is 3 months from now do I have to pay for those 3 months or is there like a move in date to start paying rent?  


How does Co-signing work? Do all the renters have to co-sign?   


How does actually purchasing work for renting a home? I know there is a down payment but is there anything more than this and what is the best way to pay?  


What are some big ass red flags when looking for homes? (Also best sites for looking for homes, right now I am using: Zillow, [Apartments.com](https://Apartments.com), and Craigslist)

I changed jobs a little over 2 years ago. I still have a dormant Fidelity 401K from my old employer.

My current employer doesn't offer 401K match so I haven't been contributing to one since though I've been saving as much cash as I could in the interim for my first house or something. I have $80K in savings and no debt, saving about $1K/month. I should probably start contributing to my current employers 401K also at some point though they don't match.

I guess my main question is about what I should consider doing with my ""old"" Fidelity 401K (TRRMX/2050).  
I feel fortunate because it was about $63K two years ago when I left my employer and is now up to about $87K. I wonder if I should put it somewhere ""safer"" IRA or something or just let it sit.

My credit unions lets me have multiple savings accounts that I contribute to every pay day. I have a catch-all account for holidays, vacations, and my kids sports. I have a spreadsheet so I know how much is allocated for each of those. When I buy, say, $100 worth of stuff for my kid's birthday I transfer that amount to my regular checking. Normally it's fine, but I'm finding it annoying b/c it's a lot of transfers and it rarely goes out/in at the same time. I inquired today about opening a basic checking account with a debit card to be linked to my joint direct deposit account for these types of expenses. My husband has one and I wanted one for the catch-all account. I was told that since I'm the primary account holder (even on a joint account) that I can only have one checking account in my name. My husband is the #2 person and so he can have a seperate one in his name. I think this is ridiculous and they could not give me a reason other than ""that's just our policy"".

Netflix is like $13 a month, hulu is $12, disney+ is $7, and HBO is $15. All of those combined are significantly less than the amount the woman paid per month to basically get advertised to by her cable provider, which she spent $150 a month on. The whole story was that she was experiencing interruptions or something on her favorite show, so the company she used reduced her plan from $165 a month to $150 a month.. and she was happy with that... until she talked with me. I'm here to tell whomever that needs to hear it, that cable providers will tell you any money figure you are willing to pay for their service. Whether its hundreds of dollars or tens, and either way they're fucking ripping you off, I swear to god.

I do want to also start doing therapy. I'm non-monogamous in my relationship and think a therapist who specializes in relationships and sex would be very good for myself & my partner and I's relationship.

I've previously had PPO plans and have an existing HSA, so I'm aware of the tax benefits. But I've heard being on a HMO can be a big disadvantage with waiting a long time for 'non-average' appointments and less specialized care.

432,(26/US) Was purchasing this condo the right decision? - SF Bay Area,"Hi there,

I know there is a rule of thumb between having 25%-35% of your monthly pay going towards mortgage and to not exceed that. I just recently moved out, I am super happy with the home, and got it off market, (2bed1bath) as a single person because I wanted independence from my parents. The off-market condo from my friend was sold to me for $490,000, and I wanted to beat the bidding war that was rampant here in the SF Bay Area. Places are going for $50,000+ over asking price.

I only have about $40,000 in savings, but I pulled a VA loan for 2.25% interest, on a 30-year fixed with 0% down. I realized the prices of houses were skyrocketing and I needed to jump now or never when it came to this purchase because of being able to buy something off-market. I did not want to keep my cash in the bank with inflation on the rise, or in the stock market, with this insane volatility. I wanted something that would scale well with the inflation like real estate. I was also getting real sick of feeling stuck at home, mentally I was just sick of being there for so long. My monthly mortgage is about $2400, plus $500 HOA, so I will be paying about $2900 a month all together just for housing.

My pay every month comes out to be around $4850-- So it is clear that 60% of my paycheck will go towards shelter, but in a way I still feel happy about the purchase because in two weeks I will be moving in and living on my own. I am completely debt free, the only debt I have will be this mortgage. So I just have to earn a raise or something to lessen the impact that the mortgage has on my paychecks.

I do understand there is tax-benefits to home ownership as in writing off the mortgage interest, and property taxes which I will receive at the end of tax season. My property tax annually will be around $6000. Can I necessarily say that these tax credits from home ownership is something I can count on to lessen the blow on my mortgage? I also can see that the equity for the house is building fast on some of the estimating calculators.

I just really wanted to leave the house because I wasn't growing mentally, and every time I told myself I would save more it just didn't happen. So I just forced myself out of the comfort zone and pulled the trigger on this one. Some might say I was stupid to, and some might say it was the right decision.

Was it a mistake to make the purchase, should I have saved more? Am I spending too much money on the house?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0t5zs/26us_was_purchasing_this_condo_the_right_decision/,1615246064.0,1,1,0

I said he does not have to do that and that he can tell me whenever he decides and that I will reserve them for him. 

Then it got weird.

He said “well I like to “play” with money” and said that he will pay me the full price right away. I ask him whether he wants the shoes and he does not even answer that and doesnt mention the shoes. It was like he desperately wanted me to have the money. I took it as a done deal - shoes for money. I gave him my bank acc. (UniCredit) but he said that this one does not have “express payment” or something like that. He asked for a PayPal which I do not have. I gave him my second bank acc which he accepted. I have to say that I cant login into my online banking on this one so I could not check and will have to get a new password which will take a few days.

438,Timing the market by choosing between Roth IRA and taxable investment accout,"I am well aware of Time in the market beats timing the market but I am curious about the statistics of choosing which account I invest in based on market conditions. Here is what I have been doing
Every month I have $2000 left over after all expenses, 401k, and hsa contributions.

My goal is to optimize my taxable account for gains in 5 years and not caring what extra returns I get in the Roth.
So every month I can easily put 500 into my Roth IRA and 1500 into a taxable account.
 Instead, if the market is at an all time high then I put $2000 into the Roth and none in the taxable. If there is a market dip or I maxed the roth, then I put the 2000 into the taxable account. 

My theory is that at an all time high then there is less of a chance of short term gain (3-5 years), so I put it in the Roth to not touch again for 30 years. When it is in a dip (3% monthly dip) then there is a greater chance of short term gains that I could use in 5 years.

So either way I will invest 2000 into a Total market index fund and will max out my Roth by the end of the year. 
What do you think of this plan?
Either way I get all market ups and downs but a chance at seeing some of the gains sooner. If this works I would pay slightly more in taxes but I value having more money outside of my retirement account because I am still young",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0x9l2/timing_the_market_by_choosing_between_roth_ira/,1615259122.0,0,0,0

440,HSA last month rule confusion,"Hi all, I was covered by a HDHP plan from May-November of 2020, and made a $3550 contribution (single filer). However, on December 2020, I no longer had a HDHP plan, and thus thought I'd only be eligible for 6 months of contributions, and thus overcontributed. However, I just called my brokerage, Fidelity, to withdraw the overcontribution, and was told due to the last month rule, I have not overcontributed and am ok for 2020. Everything I'm reading online seems to say the inverse, since I don't satisfy the testing period as I've lost HDHP coverage. Who is correct?!

In the event I have overcontributed and will need to withdraw, would it be better to just leave the overcontribution in my HSA and claim last month rule, and then pay 10% taxes on the overcontribution in 2021 (under the assumption I still get the tax deduction benefit)?

448,Need advice after years of mental health issues & neglecting debt,"CW: Mental health pertaining to depression/anxiety

Hi, as a forewarning I've been off and on reddit for years, mostly as just someone browsing, so I'm trying to learn all these rules. Please bring things to my attention (preferably in a kind manner) if I get something wrong here.

TLDR: I've avoided all debt collectors like I *don't exist* because of mental health issues and jobs that didn't pay enough to get by for years. I want to be able to answer my phone one day, forgive myself and fix it but don't know if that's possible.
-------
I need advice on what immediate steps to take trying to address various debt I've ""ignored"" for years. I've been battling major mental health issues (depression, anxiety) and have worked retail jobs that didn't pay a living wage. Living paycheck to paycheck I panicked and avoided my debts like the plague. I either couldn't pay or worried if I did try to pay them I'd set it up wrong and it would ruin me further somehow. I was discouraged that I was working so hard and still wouldn't be able to pay people I owed, eat normally or rest assured that rent would be paid. I felt trapped.

I don't know how to fix this because it feels too wrecked and I need advice on how to get out. I've even got a hit on my credit report for medical bills from an auto accident I wasn't even at fault for, I just didn't finish the paperwork through the insurance company and they closed it I think (November 2019). I was paralyzed by mental health issues, was moving at the time because I was about to be evicted and shut down further. At one point I lost touch with all friends and family for a while (repairing that now), became agoraphobic (I believe) and spiraled out so hard. I couldn't even go to the grocery. I gave up on myself and my future so I went through a period of self destructive behavior with alcohol and considered suicide daily. I have been living like I wasn't going to live forever because I didn't want to and didn't see a way out of problems I created, but now I want to live and turn this around if possible. I'm trying so hard to think it's possible to get out of this but I don't believe it yet.

I quit drinking, I worked really hard at my retail job (of 6 years). Still massively depressed and my standing there was rougher from that period of poor attendance during the binge drinking. Afraid of being fired and feeling like it was bringing me down more since the company restructured and cut everyone's hours, I quit. I went to work for a friend's company, then I got in a car accident (the one I owe a bill for, despite not being at fault and it being through work) while driving for him. It was traumatizing and painful, but I was ok. I didn't want to drive for him (or generally) anymore so I took on other roles and the situation got uncomfortable on other levels. With support from my partner I quit working for him. THEN a month or so after, the pandemic hit. MY car also broke down to the point I couldn't repair it so I sold it for scrap and used that for groceries, phone bills that I was behind on and help around here since my partner has been supporting me. So I've been out of work since about a month before the pandemic started. Longest I've ever been unemployed since I was 15. I'm very fortunate I've had my partner, they've literally kept me with a roof over my head and food to eat. I don't want them to be taken down by me and I want to start being a better person for them and myself.

To be painfully honest, I don't even *know* what my total debt is at this point. I hide the mail I do get, I haven't answered unknown numbers on my phone in years. I set up ONE payment plan for a bill that's less than $1,000 now. I have student loan debt of $50,000+, money I owed the university that went to the state attorneys or something terrifying (mishap with the loans had me owe it back to them, so I dropped out of my senior year and owe them roughly $2,000), credit cards from ages ago, the health bill for roughly $300 I shouldn't have even had to pay, possibly an old internet cable company bill I missed. I'd say if I had to ballpark guess it's about $8,000 without the student loans.... but I've got less than $100 to my name right now. I've had so many things go to collections and I don't know how to get out. I don't want to feel like a scum and a fraud every single waking moment of my life anymore, terrified and paranoid someone will sue me or find a way to punish me further than my credit score for all this. Worried about not having a future worth having. I think I'm a good person who used to have some potential years ago, I just made really bad choices, battled extreme depression and anxiety and didn't pull myself up by the bootstraps through tough times I guess. I aimed to just stay alive and take it day by day until I could process things, but that lasted years.

SO

I'm starting to look for a job now although my anxiety is still skyrocket high and I feel worthless. I don't even know if I can talk to people like a normal human being anymore, but I'm going to try to fake it. My resume is crap retail jobs for someone my age (33) and I feel like I have no future or skills anymore. I'm doing it anyway. I have to. Solid first step. I don't know whether to respond to any of the collections notices/calls, ESPECIALLY the one from the state.

Should I have tried to go on disability for the mental health issues? I never considered it because I knew a lot of people were depressed and figured that wasn't a legitimate disability even though *it is*. Who should I contact and when now that it's said and done? Wait until I get a job, or try to talk to collections now? I'm terrified, tired of running.

I know this is so much text, but there's so much in between all these things that brought me to this point and I think now the important part is that I'm admitting it's a mess and I want out. It's been a rough rough road. Thank you in advance for any advice you may be able to offer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0nec9/need_advice_after_years_of_mental_health_issues/,1615230745.0,2,2,0
449,Better to Carry Debt or Have a Larger Savings Balance,"Hello! I'll try to keep this simple as I'm just looking for some guidance. My wife and I are looking to purchase a new home (currently have a mortgage on another) sometime later this year. We have a few things we want to fix up in our current home to get it market ready. We do have some debts that include a car loan (12 months left) and a few credit cards with fairly high balances we have been working to pay off. We are very eager to get out of the area we are in and get our 7 year old daughter in a better school district.   


My question is in terms of getting financing, my current score is sitting around 726. I am about to pay off another of the credit cards at the end of the month. We do have enough money in savings to pay off the rest of the debt minus the car. But it would leave us not very much to put down on a new home. Should I keep the money in savings and go into financing with the current debts, or pay them off? 

&#x200B;

I know people are going to say don't get another house until you have a full 20% down, no other debts etc. but for our daughters sake we really need to get her into a better school district so that isn't an option.

450,Scared about my taxes (Crypto),"M/23 (Mass) Hello, sorry this may be a long post. To start this off, I got into Crypto gambling early April of 2020. I would use ethereum and bitcoin on this site to gamble with. When I would cash out (whenever I won) I would cash out through PayPal/coinbase. I am not in profit with my gambling what so ever. In the year 2020 I gambled around 5,000 dollars. I would go in, lose, lose, win big, and repeat. Never went positive realistically. Now this is where the problem begins. I used PayPal to cash out from coinbase and due to me cashing out through PayPal and my state (Massachusetts) gives me a 1099-K form because I had $600 or more on a month through my PayPal account. The 1099-K states I made 3.5k through coinbase. The problem here lies that I did not solely use coinbase to buy crypto I used 4 apps to buy cyrpto and send it to the gambling site. I don’t have access to these accounts anymore so I can not access my transaction history and the companies already said they can not help me in this regards. The only way I have to prove that I spent this money on crypto and am in the negative, is my bank statements and transactions. 2 weekends ago the person who does my taxes said she did not understand crypto or what she was looking at regarding my bank transactions and told me to do them myself and go through turbo tax. I am still a college student so I don’t even make more than 10k through working. So I don’t make a lot of money. Am I just gunna have to pay the taxes on the 3.5k I essentially took through PayPal at this point? Or does turbo tax have a section for cyrpto etc. I have never used turbo tax and don’t really want to pay the taxes on 3.5k I don’t essentially owe. Sorry if this post is confusing.

Maybe the wrong place to post so forgive me in advance.

I am decently qualified for a few bank roles but keep getting declined and have made amendments to my resume and cover letter etc. but have yet to succeed in getting a role with a bank.

However, I always get interviews and offers from smaller companies.

Unlike smaller companies I have noticed that banks use SnapHire as a platform for recruitment- my question is that is the software using key word based approaches to short list applicants for the HR consultant to then review? Rather than a human being checking the resume? 

I am wanting to get to the bottom of how the system works so I know what to work on/get rid off on my resume to increase the probability of being short listed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0s261/snaphire_recruitment/,1615242803.0,0,0,0

463,20 years old...what to do with 20k in the bank?,"I'm a junior in college. I have a full tuition scholarship from my school, and between work and money from Covid stiumulus and grants I had saved up about $28,000 by the end of 2020. I opened a Roth IRA and maxed it out at 6k. I plan on doing the same thing for 2021. Most of the IRA is in a basic S&P500 index fund. 

After last year's Roth IRA contributions, I'm left with about 22k. I make enough during the school year to breakeven on month-to-month expenses. During the summer I work long hours and I expect to add another 10k on to my savings, so I'll have 32k by the end of this year. 

By the time I graduate I will have taken out 20k in federal subsidized loans. These have no interest until six months after I graduate (May 2022), so I don't think its wise to pay them off now. No other debt. 

I currently live near public transit so I don't *need* a car, but I've been thinking about buying a used one in the < $12,000 range for a while. If I bought a car now I can see myself using it for at least the next five years -- and it's very likely I would need a car to commute when I graduate next year. 

I'm really not sure what to do with the money. I'd keep a minimum of 4k for emergencies in a high yield savings account, but that leaves me with about $18k, which will be $28k after this summer. Should I make all my 2021 Roth IRA contributions early? I know I'm missing out on interest if its just in the bank, so where should I keep the money otherwise? 

Once I settle down (within the next \~5 years) I can also see myself putting a down payment on a home, rather than paying into rent, but that's just an idea I'm toying with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0rxof/20_years_oldwhat_to_do_with_20k_in_the_bank/,1615242459.0,1,1,0

467,Don't discount car insurance quotes for long-term savings.,"I was having a discussion with a coworker and this led me to dig around in my Mint budgeting app to see what I was paying with my previous car insurance company..  

Details: Car in reference is a 2015 VW GTI that is fully paid, no tickets for 7+ years minimum and no at fault accidents ever in my 25+yrs of driving.  Not married, not a home owner.. 

I was previously with Progressive and had performed the snapshot program to the tune of a 17% discount and if memory serves me correctly these were with $2,000 deductibles for full coverage.  My records only go back to 2016 but with all discounts I could obtain these were my 6 month payment amounts.

$377

$419

$461

$497

By the last one I had caught on that something was amiss and I called Progressive asking them why my car continues to age and lower in value, my record is clean yet my rates continue to go up.  They fed me some lines about market pricing etc which I couldn't be bothered to buy into and immediately went insurance shopping.  

Switching to Geico I actually dropped my deductibles to $1k for collission and $250 for other bc the fee differences were nominal and these are the results I have on record.

$344

$291

$288

$275

$235 (Covid discount)

$275 (my upcoming payment)

469,Sell condo to get into a home?,"Context: My dad bought a condo outright for me to live in 6 years ago for $135k. I was in school and had very low income. Now, I just recently secured an increase to my income that will total around $90k/year. Real estate in our area appears to be peaking and two different realtors have evaluated the value of the condo to be $260k to $270k. Housing on the market in this price range are also seeing some decent up-bidding when being sold, so we are being told there is a chance it could hit $300k. I have $5000 in savings, and probably around $5000 in physical assets. No debt, very little monthly bills. I would like to eventually move into a home and start a family with my SO. (We are late 20's, so having kids soon is on our minds).



Question: Does it make sense to sell this condo at the (seemingly) top of the market and use it to finance and get into something more expensive? Such as a $600k to $800K home (there are hardly any single family homes under $600k in my area)? Or does it make more sense to stay in the condo longer and gain this new income with little bills and build more savings, but potentially lose out on the absurd increase in the condo's value?

474,IRS removed Recovery Rebate Credit from my return.,"So basically the story goes like this.

I received the first stimulus check for $1200 no problem, I received it via direct deposit.

Then the second stimulus check rolls around, and nothing comes through by deposit or mail. I was and still am eligible for the payment but no luck. The “get my payment” page on the IRS website offered no explanation either, but the website said I could apply for the Recovery Rebate Credit on my tax return if I didn’t receive the stimulus check I was eligible for. So that’s what I did.

Fast forward to my return being deposited, and guess what, there is still no stimulus attached to it. 

I call the IRS and the recording informs me that the recovery rebate was removed from my return due to a lack of eligibility. The problem is that I am most definitely eligible. I make less than 75,000 dollars per year, I am not claimed as a dependent, etc.

Does anyone know why I am still being denied the payment? And how I should argue with them when they finally take my call? (They aren’t even accepting my call at this time due to “high call volume”)

* I'm recently unemployed, in my early 30s, UX/Product Designer. I spent 5 years at my previous employer, left 03/01/2021, and received severance:
   * 12 weeks paid leave ($15,080.77 deposited 03/05/2021)
   * COBRA + option to keep equipment
* Savings need love but I'm trying (pls don't laugh):
   * Citi Accelerate: $1,313.80
   * Qapital: $520.89
   * Yotta: $200.12
      * **Total Savings: $2,034.81**
* Applying for unemployment but not approved yet. My current cash/checking account:
   * **Total Cash: $16,452.70**
* Student Loans (in forbearance until 09/30/2021) are:
   * 1 Consolidated/Subsidized: $26,615.56
   * 1 Consolidated/Unsubsidized: $45,549.62
      * **Total Student Loan Debt: $72,233.36**
* Credit Cards:
   * Citi Double Cash | 22.74% APR | Credit Limit: $3,000 | Current Balance: $1,328
   * Capital One Quicksilver | 24.24% APR | Credit Limit: $2,500 | Current Balance: $1,846
   * Capital One Venture | 22.99% APR | Credit Limit: $8,000 | Current Balance: $6,6,79
   * American Express Blue Cash Everyday | 0% APR for 15mo. | 0 Balance (just got this one)
      * **Total Credit Card Debt: $9,852**
* Other:
   * Affirm | 0% APR | Financed: $1,114.56 | Paid To Date: $557.28
      * **Total Affirm Debt: $557.28**

My goal is to build savings while paying off my debt (whose isn't), but I wonder if there are times when you should de-prioritize building your savings to pay off your debt? Is it foolish of me to prioritize paying off my credit card debt knowing that when I do have to start paying back my loans, that interest is going to sting?

I've done my best to outline some 2 paths I'm considering below...welcoming any feedback on which  makes more sense to people, where ya'll would focus your efforts first, and really just would love any insight on how to make the most of this unexpected severance money considering my circumstances. 

**Path 1: Use severance to pay off CC/Affirm then save the rest**

1. Pay $9,852 (CC) + $557.28 (Affirm) = Pay $10,409.28 total
2. $10,409.28 - $15,080.77 (severance) = $4,671.49 left over
   1. At this point, I would probably deduct \~1 mo living expenses and deposit the rest into my existing Citi savings account...If I consolidate my three savings accounts, I get to $6,706.30. Do ya'll recommend dividing that money differently? For example, should I put 5k in a CD with Ally, and keep a portion in Citi since it has such a high APY?

(+)'s: quickly pay off cc debt, improve credit, still get to have some money go into savings and can fall back on CCs in the event it takes me longer than 3 months to find work.

(-)'s: severance is pretty much gone in one shot

**Path 2: Use severance to pay off debts w/ highest interest then save the rest**

1. Pay $1,846 (Quicksilver) + $1,328 (Citi Double Cash) = $3,174 total
2. $3,174 - $15,080.77 (severance) = $11,906.77 left over
   1. At this point, I would redirect the funds I budgeted for my minimum monthly Quicksilver + Citi payments over to my Venture card balance.

(+)'s: can make a dent in CC/high interest debt and establish a strong savings, severance money can be stretched over a longer period of time to account for unexpected expenses/invest/etc.

(-)'s: student loan/high interest debt stays the same, a little concerned about it taking longer than 3 months to find work and having to end up dipping into savings after accruing additional credit card debt.

481,Confusing 2019/2020 tax refund/EIP situation. Please help.,"Hello, all. I have a somewhat confusing tax return/stimulus payment situation. Please bear with me. 

Calendar Year 2020: I filed my Tax Year 2019 tax return electronically via TaxAct, but TaxAct rejected the filing since somebody else used my SSN. I had to then physically re-file with Form 14039. IRS and I got in touch and they said my 2019 tax return issue has been resolved and I should be getting my $1K refund in a few weeks. During this same call, they said I should file a 2nd Form 14039 as I did not receive the first $1200 EIP either (IRS website shows the $1200 was paid, but to the wrong bank account). So I did that. 

Calendar Year 2021: I call the IRS since by now I did not receive my Tax Year 2019 refund yet nor the $1200 1st EIP. IRS says that since I filed the 2nd Form 14039, the whole refund+EIP investigation got jumbled together and requires more time. As of March 2021, I still haven’t received my 2019 refund, $1200 EIP, or the 2nd $600 EIP (I did not receive the second EIP since my 2019 return is still “processing” and the second EIP is based on the 2019 return). I am eligible for both EIPs. 

**So thank you for making it this far. My questions are: at this time, should I file Form 3911 to request a trace for the 1st $1200 EIP, or is my 2nd Form 14039 already handling that? Should I request $1200 + $600 = $1800 on my Tax Year 2020 return for the Recovery Credit this year even though the investigation is pending for the first EIP? Is there anything I should/can do for my 2019 tax refund (is there a credit I can claim this year)?**

484,What details should I pay attention to when deciding where to open an IRA? Explain target date funds to me?,"After my last post, I'm hoping to be more specific about my lack of understanding. I have read the prime directive and generally understand the steps, and options for them. Going by that, I think a smart move for me is to open and begin funding an IRA (Likely a Roth). I'm 22, working part-time (Making more than my previous full-time) and have no debts or loans. I'm on break from college, but have paid it all out of pocket, and don't plan to have student loans anytime soon. My employer does not offer a 401k and their offered retirement plan likely doesn't apply to me, because I don't think I will be employed with them long enough to actually benefit. It's a really odd and kinda bad plan.  


I can afford to make maximum contributions to an IRA, but I'm not sure where I should open one. Currently I'm banking with Chase, but it seems like general consensus is to get away from the large brick and mortar financial institutions. I don't trade, but would like to learn to. Am I best off joining a credit union, and going through them? Going online with something like Fidelity or TD Ameritrade? Or sticking with Chase, if they offer one? 

I don't entirely understand the differences in fund and investment offerings from the online brokerage options. I also don't really know how I would use a target date fund, because I have no idea when I would retire or how to gauge that. The earlier, the better. And lastly, I don't know if it's beneficial to manage my own investments (which would require a lot of research and learning from here), or to just fund an account I don't need to really manage.  


To clarify, I know what most of these things ARE, but not how they really apply, or what I need to personally pay attention to.

495,Upside Down on Car Loan,"I’m working on getting out of debt and have made some great progress so far. However, I’m looking for some advice on how to deal with my car loan which was an extremely idiotic decision and a big life lesson.

Loan details
Loan balance = $15,000 (includes negative equity)
Term = 84 months
Rate = 5.3%
Payment = $283
KBB private party value = $9,500 to $11,500

Other details
Gross salary = $50,000
Federal student loan in my name = $29,000
PLUS student loan = $20,000

Would it be better to pay the car loan down and refinance to get a lower term and hopefully a better rate or sell it privately? I’ve never sold a car privately that isn’t paid off but I assume it’s a pain and turns buyers away. 

I have some money that I could use to get the loan close to being out from under water. I wasn’t sure if it would be worthwhile to then try to get a personal loan for the remainder to pay off the car and get the title in hand before selling.

I don’t mind buying a cheap, old car to drive while I attack my student loans. My hesitation is that I have a little over an hour round trip commute to work as well as zero mechanical knowledge so I’d be paying to have repairs done. However, I realize that newer cars like the one I have now can also break down and that having a car payment while trying to get out of debt is counterintuitive.

I lived in the US where my ex-employer set up an LLC for me through which I was allowed to open a bank account in Miami, FL.

Before the pandemic I went to the EU and never came back due to the problems with a company that transferred me. Some time ago I wired to the account $2K USD (which is at CHASE) so that they do not constantly charge me with monthly fees.

However, now I received an information that they are closing my account, I am unable to transfer/zelle/global wire the funds and that they will not be able to send the check to the EU. Apparently there is no other way for me to get the funds from Chase than a check issued to the business (individual LLC) account.

The current status of the LLC on Sunbiz is ""Inactive ADMIN DISSOLUTION FOR ANNUAL REPORT""

I can have the check sent to a friend of mine, however, I was told that they will not be able to cash it at a bank since they do not cash business checks.

Is there any way someone else could cash a business check in my name? Is there any other procedure I could perhaps ask the bank to do?

I don't currently have the disposable income, obviously, to pay $8k to get this going, so my question is, would it be worth it to try to get a loan to pay to get this off the ground? Does it seem smart to go further in debt for this?

But if that ETFs price goes up, when you deposit again , let's say 100$ , the ETF would be pricier. So , how do you actually do it ? You just buy more monthly if it keeps going up?

We're a suburban family of 4, married, in our 40's, two pre-teen kids and two dogs.. total take home pay after taxes is $135k.

No debt other than the mortgage, both vehicles we own outright and still have several years of life left, so we are definitely keeping more than we make and saving, which is great, but I feel like not as aggressive as we could or should be.  So I categorized what I'll call ""discretionary"" expense for the year 2020.  Everything from random kids stuff, auto maintenance, home/garden, restaurants, pets, hair/beauty, pharmacy, groceries, clothes, booze, ""misc. household stuff"", travel, gifts and subscription services.

I was shocked to learn this comprised nearly 58% of our total take home pay. Even more shocked to see that of that,  ""grocery stores and warehouse clubs (i.e. Costco)"" was 26% of that!  \~$20k a year for groceries and all the misc. household stuff one gets at those big box club stores.  Is this normal for your average middle-class suburban family of 4? The bar on my graph for this category was nearly 3x bigger than anything else. 

The ""non discretionary"" (fixed) expenses (i.e. mortgage, taxes, insurance (auto/home/life/disability), utilities, gas, comprises 19% of our take home pay which means we're saving \~23% of our take-home pay (on top of pre-tax qualified contributions)

513,Student Loan Payments vs Saving for Home Purchase?,"Hi PF,

My wife and I have been paying down debt as fast as possible over the last several years, while saving as much as possible in the meantime. Currently we have right around 12K in Credit Card debt (mostly from a recent cross-country move for a new job). We just paid off both of our cars in the past 4 months.

I am still in school, but will finish with my Master's degree next spring, and will have about 65K in Student Loans when everything is said and done, with a 6-month grace period before re-payment begins Payments will start being due Fall of 2022. 

We currently rent an apartment that fits our needs (and costs) while still being located in a safe part of a mid-sized midwest city. (1700 rent per month for a 3BR). We would like to purchase a home in the next 1.5 years, and our credit scores are improving slightly as we pay down CC Debt each month. (Both around 650). I make 85K/yr, single earner, 4 children. (The masters degree will most likely not help much with my income/earnings at my job, but will be helpful in a few years once I jump to another job.) I can use my VA home loan certificate to help with a (very low or zero) down payment, but this isn't likely a good scenario as we would like to stay competitive with the current competitive sellers market. We would like to purchase a 3BR/2BA home for under 250K in our area, but we will have to see what pricing looks like once our current lease is up.

My first question is : Should we divert our down-payment savings to student loans to improve our chances of a better home loan rate in the future, or keep it as cash and go with the availability to pay off a large chunk of Student Loan Debt once they become due? Or begin paying on them right now to help lower interest? 

Secondly, is there such a thing as a personal accountant/financial advisor that I could pay a one time fee to sit down and go through everything with us to help with planning; that would also not try to sell us any services? I think a one-time service of this kind would be worth shelling out 300-400 dollars to get some solid advice to help move us forward.

520,"Home needs massive repairs, credit isn't great. Do I have any options?","I'm going to be completely transparent: I had more money when I bought a house a few years ago. It was foreclosed and sold as is. I didn't make the best financial decisions and I'm just trying to figure out where to go from here. I no longer have any savings/inheritance left. Here's the quick details: the home is tax valued at 140k. I paid 55k. I make 35k a year. I have a credit score of about 610 according to credit karma and am carrying about 11k in credit card debt. Again, I know I haven't made the best financial decisions. I struggled with mental health and some other things and am basically playing ""clean up"" from that time period now. I do not have the money for the massive repairs needed. I filled out some online forms for home equity loans to try to get the repairs done and consolidate my credit card debt. The problem is I don't have insurance on the home, and there's no way it will pass inspection if any lenders require the inspection. The home is about 100 years old.

Do I have any options for a loan to help consolidate debt and get the home repaired? Or is selling it as is the best option?

524,URGENT: Primerica offered me a job but its starting to look like a scam.,"I saw someone posted about Primerica on this page before, but that was 6 years ago. So I'm posting this in hopes of potential clarity from others.

A high-school friend contacted me out of the blue recently and asked me if I'd like to work for Primerica. He repped it up so much that I thought it was an amazing opportunity. I said yes, and the interview I had with the manager was fantastic. However, things are starting to not add up to me:
1. They require a ~125$ (something like that) fee to get onto training
2. Apparently they ALSO deduct 25 dollars from your account every month just for being an employee, I learned about this from my best friend who was planning to take the job with me. 
3. I decided to investigate online. There's positive reviews from employees, but there's also a staggering number of incredibly negative reviews left by both customers AND employees, largely complaining of fraudulent activity.

I've never heard of this company before my old friend offered the job to me. I want to trust that an old friend wouldn't try to scam me, but this situation is really starting to shape up into a scam. If anyone has any experience whatsoever with the company and would like to share their experience with it, or even if you have advice at all, I'd love to hear it! I'll be starting on Wednesday and I have a feeling I need to act quick and decide if I want to quit or not before then.

Our long term goal is to move to Nevada, but that's probably \~5 years out. Our California home is \~5 miles from the CA/NV border, and our Nevada ranch is \~10 miles past the border on the NV side.

Me: I've been spending more and more time in Nevada at the ranch working. We have livestock now so someone needs to be there all the time, basically. I have a remote job that I can do wherever I go, and I do.

Spouse: My spouse spends most of her time in California, and earns an income in California.

Kids: My kids are homeschooled now, but will be attending public school in California.

I'm running into some challenges by not being a Nevada resident. There's a professional license I'd like to get and it requires me to be a Nevada resident (Nevada ID). Also, the more time I spend there the more I'm interested in shifting my voting because I want to have an official say in things and participate.

526,Ear doctor visit - Question about my bill,"I have been to doctors from time to time and each time only had to pay a $30 copay, for example during visits to my arthritis doctor. 

I went to have my ear checked (I thought it was full of wax, but there turned out to be no problem with my ear). My bill looks like this:

Comp Audiometry Threshold Eval: Insurance paid $0,           patient balance $45.96   
Tympanometry:                                  Insurance paid $0,           patient balance $17.72  
Binocular microscopy:                       Insurance paid $0,           patient balance $37.18  
OV, New Pt, Level II:                           Insurance paid $64.30,   patient balance $30

The first two charges seem to be some sort of a hearing exam, which actually was performed. The third charge seems to be the doctor looking into my ear with a handheld microscope, which she did, but I do not understand why that is not a part of the fourth charge, which is the office visit for which I paid $30. 

In any case, is this normal? Should service like this not be included in my copay?

529,To buy a rental property or not,"Hi PF,

I need some advice from the collective regarding buying a rental property. Right now I'm considering buying a townhome in the city I currently reside. It's not much to buy - market has it at 160k which is fair value considering it's on a golf course in a sought after suburb and comps. The HOA fees are roughly $150 USD/mo and covers exterior maintenance of the structure, lawn and landscape, trash, sewer, and insurance. I can rent this property for $1,250 - $1,300/mo - Anticipating I may be able to get closer to $1,400/mo in 2022 based on the local market trend. 

**My predicament and question are this:** I want to buy, live there for about a year, then rent it out when I move. I don't plan on staying in this city due to the job market for my profession and I require a larger metro for that reason. So I don't plan on staying here for the foreseeable future. Is it worth it to do this? I know housing is a relatively poor appreciating asset shorter-term historically. Having some additional passive income while having the asset appreciate, even 2-4%/yr for 5 or so years (vs. the 11% this past year on average in my market) sounds pretty good, even putting the profit into the principal to pay that down a bit.  

Financials in case they're needed: 120k/yr salary working remote, only debt is my car at 30k remaining on the loan, saving 10% into 401k, 6,500/yr into Roth IRA, and rest I invest in the market on my own time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0n923/to_buy_a_rental_property_or_not/,1615230368.0,1,1,0

I never sent in notice that I was going to vacate my apartment and according to the lease, I am automatically placed under month to month rate which is fine; however, the month to month rate is more than a 25 percent increase from my original rate.

1. And I was just wondering if the apartment had to provide notice of the actual increased values/monthly rate because the lease they sent me did not provide any month to month numbers.

If so, I also have a second issue. I went in to tell them that I never got a rate increase notice (in my email OR portal) and they said, according to their system, they sent me one...? They told me the exact date and time but when I checked, the only email I got from them was a promo for an early bird special that had nothing to do with the increase. Whats weird is when I asked if they had history of sending the promo, they said no (so overall, it seems like their system's mailing history is inconsistent).

2. So if the apartment is required to send in a rate increase notice, does it only matter if they haveproof that they sent it but I never received it (again through email or resident portal)? (hopefully this makes sense)

Do I have a chance of fighting for my month to month rate increase to return to my usual rate? Thank you guys!

540,AmEx Charge Off Question," 

I’m trying to help my brother with his credit, but I am no financial expert. He currently has a credit score of: Experian: 559; TransUnion: 598, Equifax :564. He would like to buy a house in the near future, but needs to work on increasing his credit score before he can even think about doing that.

&#x200B;

There isn't much on his credit report. Only one open credit card that has a $250 limit with exceptional payment history and an old, closed account.  From what I can tell, he had an AMEX card that he opened back in 2007, accrued a balance of about 3500 and never paid it. AMEX marked it as a ""charge off"" for several months beginning in 2018 before completely closing the account last year. His credit report does not show any open collection accounts, but it does show 30 charge offs (all from the same AMEX card.)

I find it odd that there’s no collections account open.

He says he’s received negotiation letters in the past that appear to be directly from AMEX, but never paid or settled the amount owed because he heard that was a bad thing to do.

He’s in a position where he can now pay the balance in full…should he do it? I am leaning towards yes, but am looking for some input from those who are much wiser than I….If he is to pay in full, should he contact AMEX directly? Should he ask for a “pay-for-delete.” I’ve heard those are very rare, but I guess it couldn’t hurt to ask.

Then, after he pays it off, what is the best way for him to go about increasing his score? I thought about adding him to one of my credit card accounts (since I pay off every month) to help him out or having him get a secured credit card. 

We live in Virginia if that matters at all.

We need something that we can set up and then forget about for several years.  Is a CD really the best way to go, or something else?

&#x200B;

And I know this question has been asked 1000 times, but we're just starting to use our HSA for retirement purposes instead of current medical expenses so we're looking to invest what's in the account now.  Is that type of investment still better through Vanguard, or is Fidelity ok?  Employer has it easily set up for Fidelity but I have a Vanguard account so could make that work, but would rather take the easy route if all things are equal.

544,"My tax preparer didn't file my 2017 and 2018 taxes. I just found out and now she's ghosting me, what do I do and what kind of penalties should I expect?","The title pretty much explains it, so here's some context:

* 2 weeks ago I got a notice from the state of California saying I didn't file in 2017 for my LLC and that I had to file within 30 days of the notice (I haven't received any notices from the IRS though).
* Sent my (ex) tax preparer the notice. She said that's because my returns for 2017 *and* 2018 were not ""mailed in."" I asked why she hadn't e-filed, and she said that her software didn't allow it. She flaked on a meeting I requested last week and hasn't responded to emails since then.
* I found the invoice for my 2017 preparation that includes e-filing, so that was definitely part of the services she should have provided.
* Before she ghosted, she sent me my returns for 2017 and 2018. My tax liability for 2017 was around 4k and a similar amount for 2018, but I didn't pay because I was in the red those years and assumed I didn't have any taxes, also because she didn't tell me I had any to pay (my mistake). So I assume I'm looking at 7 combined years of late fees.

I'm pretty anxious and I don't know what to do.  I have so many questions, but here are the ones that are most urgent for me:

1. Should I just mail those two old tax returns with checks to the IRS and wait for a response?
2. Can/should I hold her accountable for not filing? if so, how?Any advice you have is much appreciated!  


EDIT: update

Thanks for all of the advice everyone! Since this is blowing up, I can't respond to everyone, so I want to just clear up some stuff:

* This preparer is a CPA
* **I didn't pay initially because I didn't know anything about paying taxes at the time.** It was never explained to me and we don't educate kids about it in this country, so yes believe it or not, I didn't know that I owed money because I was waiting for the CPA to guide me through it because that's what my parents' CPA did when I was a kid. I didn't know then, now I know.
* **I will not take action against her right now.** It's entirely possible that this CPA is very busy and just bad at responding to emails when overwhelmed with work. There are many ways that this could be a misunderstanding - for example, she could have filed my taxes, but this one form slipped the radar. I just don't know because she isn't available to clarify.

549,Credit Card App Denied: I don’t understand,"Hey all!

So I am a very responsible credit card user but I do have quite a few. I opened many for the rewards and also use specific ones for specific things based on points.
It’s just fun for me honestly.

I have a clean record with on time payments and my credit utilization is only 2%. 

I have 8 cards open (1 of those I’m an authorized user on and not the primary holder). 
I was looking to get a new card, which I was going to replace an old card with. I would ultimately close that old card once the new card arrives.

It’s a US Bank credit card and I was denied because “Max amount of unsecured credit already available”. I don’t really understand, I didn’t think this could happen even after trying to research online. And my credit score is well within the “recommended credit score” for the card. 

So, in order to get the card.. would it be best to close some accounts I don’t use? Or could I just call and ask them to lower my credit limit (I imagine that’s a possibility)? Like is that what this letter means?

And how long until I can try again?

And lastly, further on in the letter they told me they got my credit score yada yada and told me a few items That are adversely effecting my score. But I imagine that since my credit score isn’t listed in the “reasons you were denied” section that I don’t need to concern myself with those “adverse effects” as my credit score is still good. 

Thanks yall!

Edit: when I say call and lower my credit limit, I mean on the cards the I don’t use as well as some cards who’s credit limit is much higher than it needs to be. Ex. I frequent 1 store a lot so that’s the only “store” credit card I have. And it’s credit limit is about 3x higher than I need it to be. It also happens to be at the same bank that I’m trying to get the new credit card from.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0lzye/credit_card_app_denied_i_dont_understand/,1615227273.0,0,0,0

Any way he sent the money to this persona venmo account who then blocked him on fb and took down the posting. I found the venmo account and the fb account that was used. 

He already contacted venmo and they said they can't get the money back but they can reprimand the account (so helpful)

We also talked to his bank and they said something dumb about they will return the money but if they investigate and find that he actually did send the money then they will take it back.

However, due to the pandemic, they now only offer loans on houses above $200k, which means I need to find a new lender for my next property. Does anyone know any banks with low-interest rates/fees for rental properties under 100k? I plan on putting 20% down.

560,"Employer and ""Temporary"" Remote Status","Hi all,

I'm looking for advice on what folks would do if they were in my position.  My job, prior to COVID, had a WFH policy of 2 days per week.  Per COVID, we've been remote for about a year now.  I mustered up the courage to ask my job about going full remote permanently and moving out of state.  Employer is based in NJ, I moved to VA.

I got the OK from everyone, including HR and moved.  I changed my address and HR has it on file.  However, they are considering things ""temporary"".  There's a couple reasons why, but one of them being that we may/may not have an impending merger with another organization and they ""don't know what the policy will be if that goes through"".  I have dug for more information and from what I gather, everyone at my current org is OK with me being permanently remote - but they are waiting to see what happens with this merger.

&#x200B;

To give some more background, I am still making the same salary.  I get benefits through my wife's job, and we have a hefty savings right now.  No kids.  However, I do want to buy a house maybe later this year or early next.  I do like my job, my boss, and my org very much.

&#x200B;

1) Should I stick this out to see how things go with making me full-time out-of-state remote?

2) How long do I wait until they give me a more permanent answer?  There may or may not be some activity later in the second-half of the year that will accelerate the process of knowing what is going on with the possible merger.

3) There are other opportunites that I am well qualified for right now in my state / permanent remote that I can apply for now.  I may have to take a bit of a paycut, but it's something I'm willing to do if it needs to be done.

So last September I applied for an entry level corporate job working with sales tax. I've been employed with my current employer (collection of sales tax on motor vehicles is part of the job) for 4 years now so I used that to show some sort of a similarity between positions when interviewing. During both of the interviews with my potential manager and department head, they both were trying to get me to admit to lying about something on my resume, but there was nothing that I lied about so they eventually dropped it. I was offered the job which paid a dollar more an hour than my current job, but it came with a few benefits. Well, my current employer countered so I stayed. Small business ran by my mom.

Several months later, the department head called my office to schedule an appointment to renew her drivers license which is something we can do. She was telling me over the phone that she compares current applicants to me and she really liked me and wished me the best. She comes in for the renewal and it's normal enough, then she calls my personal line a few days later to offer me another job. Slightly different than the first one with a little better pay. No additional interview or anything, just an application for a background check and a job offer.

I feel really weird about the way they went about it though. Several months after turning them down, they came at me again at my own place of business on an hour from where she lives.

I currently have a limited position for work, making about 100k/year. Will get three 2% raises per year for the next 4 years. The job ends in 2030 and pay scale may become stagnant in 2025. My only debt is a home loan at 15% of current gross income, and general bills.

I have limited knowledge of how the pension is determined, and know that my recent yearly statement says if I were to quit now and cash it out it will be worth 40k before taxes/fees, I can't really project its potential worth when I get laid off.

Now, they are both going through the process of bankruptcy (together) and I have a college checking account (with a fair bit more money because I began working) that is completely within my name and theoretically shouldn’t be connected to them in any way...

570,Have large down payment for home. How to get the best rate?,"Long story short, we have a large down payment for a home (>50%). We already signed a purchase agreement.

Now, we're looking at our financing. Currently, we have quite a few pre-approvals and are shopping for the best rate and are also trying to decide whether to rate-lock. We decided on a 30-yr mortgage, and we see the rates on those are climbing a little, and our home won't close until October-ish. Our down payment is at least 50% of the purchase price. I'm pretty sure lenders love people like us. 

That said, what can we do to secure the best rate? Will lenders fight for us? Today, as of this writing, the lowest quote we got was for 3.056% APR for the 30-yr mortgage. What's your experience with high down payments like this?

573,Got charged for mortgage insurance twice,"Hi All,

Firstly thanks everyone here for sharing great for information on different situations. It has been of a great help for me personally.

Last year in July, my mortgage insurance was out of coverage for two months. As my auto-payment did not take effect after 1 year by farmers insurance. Then my mortgage lender charged me $841 immediately (I noticed this only in Sept as it was hidden on my mortgage account, only realized when my mortgage payment increased by $50). Later I got it activated again through farmers insurance in sept 2020, starting from July 2020. When I contacted my mortgage lender at the time they asked me to send proof of insurance and they would revert the insurance.

It took so many months to settle this. Now mortgage company says we went through farmers insurance documents and it is showing that I am out of coverage. Farmers insurance only response is we have provided the required information.

What are my options to get this refunded from either of them. Based on my conversations I have a feeling mortgage lender won't budge. Appreciate and suggestions.

574,How do I even start when I feel lile nothing will work no matter what I do?,"Hello,


I've been reading posts on here for a while from a different account and I have some questions because a few of the suggestions haven't worked for me. 

Here it goes...

I'm a 34 year old single mom making 18K a year living in low income housing and get food stamps and medicaid. The kids' Dad pays child support sporadically and the amounts vary greatly. I have jo support system whatsoever. The kids are 14, 13, 9 and 8.

I have no credit card debt or any other debt other than student loan debt which is at 62,000 from a for profit college that has since closed and my degree from there pays peanuts so I took a job not in my field to support us. These student loan payments are payed by the government on an income based repayment plan.


Because of the government paying those loans my credit is a 648 but my income to debt ratio is bad and I can't even do anything to build this credit.

My questions are;

1. How can I get a prepaid credit card if I can't even get approved for one to start building my credit.

2. Should I kill myself to pay these loans (I pay every bill up for a year with my income taxes every tax season so I won't be throwing that at it.) The money I earn usually goes to repair my stupid old car it's insane among other things that come up with school, etc.

3. What do I do for a car? I have tried to avoid a car loan and have payed a ton of money to keep my 03 Camry with 198K miles going.


I guess what I'm really asking is where do I start and how? I'm very worried about my car. I guess I can't get credit without paying off my student loan debt but they are talking about forgiving 50K of it on the news. I can't get a secured card. If I do pay my student loans and something happens with my car I won't have the money. 


I'm sorry I'm rambling I'm just upset and never comment or post anything and am just at my wits end and scared. I just feel like with this 3rd stimulus check I may be able to help the situation but I don't want to make the situation worse by making it better. Please help.

Also, I'm a waitress and tips vary by season if that helps. Thank you guys so much for your help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0kosb/how_do_i_even_start_when_i_feel_lile_nothing_will/,1615224012.0,1,1,0

576,"I wanted to roll over a Pension to a Roth IRA, got a 1099-R with $0 taxable income","I had a pre-tax pension account that I wanted to roll over to my Roth IRA because I left the job. They sent me a check for the full amount ($16k) and told me to put it in the Roth myself, and pay taxes on it. I had already made the $6000 contribution for the year. I was kind of surprised that I was allowed to deposit the FULL $16k into my Roth, rather than the post-tax amount (maybe $12k) but that's fine by me, I would pay the taxes later, I said. I am under 59.5, no other crazy situations, I was just trying to roll over the Pension into a Roth IRA and pay taxes on it.

The problem is, I got my 1099-R and box 2a, taxable amount, shows $0. Distribution code G. ""Taxable amount not determined"" box 2b was NOT checked. I am using Turbotax, and I feel like I'm at the end and there's still no indication that I owe the IRS anything more than usual. If I go change the box 2a (taxable amount) to the full amount of the payment ($16k) then my taxable amount goes up by about $4k. But after talking to the bank and the IRS, this is not the right way to do this. So far this seems like the best way to do it. I'm not thrilled about paying $4k in taxes of course, but the proportion of the $16k seems about right, and Turbotax does not do any other flags. But I am changing the form.

If I enter my Roth IRA contributions as $22k ($6k normal, plus $16k roll over) then Turbotax does say I owe taxes, but it also starts talking about a penalty for over-contributing, which should not be the case for me, right? I don't mean taxes, it calculates that too, but also penalties. Also the taxes owed seem smaller than the above manipulation. Maybe that is correct, the IRS said 25% sounded too high for the $16k, but I don't know.

The IRS said I could wait for a form 5498, but that gets here after my taxes are due, so how do I know what to pay? I really don't want to pay $4k, then fill out more paperwork in a couple months because I over/underpaid by $5.

Can anyone help? I didn't think I would need to hire someone for what was described to me as a simple rollover.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0klda/i_wanted_to_roll_over_a_pension_to_a_roth_ira_got/,1615223766.0,1,1,0
577,Questions about Retirement Strategy for New Job," 

I am switching a job from the private sector to the public sector and will have very different retirement options and wanted to explore the best possible strategies moving forward. I started fulltime at 24 years old so I feel a bit behind in my retirement path. 

**Current Retirement Assets (Age 30)** 

* 401k: $106k 
* HSA: $21k 
* No Roth IRA or anything else. 

**Current Job Benefits and Contributions:** 

* 16% 401k from $82k Salary 
* 5% 401k match from employer 
* $2600 to HSA from myself 
* $1000 from employer 

**Annual Total Pre-Tax retirement contribution: $20,820** 

**Future Job Benefits:** 

* Salary 98k 
* MEBT (401k equivalent) Matches up to 6.2% 
* Healthcare: no HDHP – no HSA contributions anymore 
* PERS – Pension plan 

My goal is to match or increase retirement contributions of previous job of $20,820 a year. 

However, when exploring the MEBT program, I see that funds are picked for everyone and I have no choice in funds to select. My current 401k is thru fidelilty and we have pretty good selection of funds. Since im young, I have selected aggressive ETF’s and have done well in performance. Upon analyzing the MEBT, the allocation is much more conservative side and as a result has vastly underperformed the market (sp500) from 2009 to 2018. For example, 2009 – 2017 the MEBT avged 10.22% returns while Sp500 returned 13.2%, every year was worse in %growth or %loss. As a result, I am more relucant to contribute more than the minimum 6.2% match through the MEBT 

**Planned Retirement** **Contributions:** 

* At minimum, contribute 6.2% to 401k to get full match. 
* Start a roth ira and max it out $6k and pick low expensive aggressive funds thru a brokerage. 
* Adds up to $12,152 pre-tax in 401k a year and $6,000 in post-tax retirement.  

Take into account that the job pays into a pension rather than Social security and the pension plan is vastly superior to my understanding. Example: work 5 years and u get 10% of ur highest average income for the rest of your life after retirement. 10 years= 20%, 20 year = 40%, etc. I plan to stay at minimum 5 years and likely 10-20 years+ 

**Some Questions I had:** 

* Do you feel 6.2% contribution and maxing roth IRA is adequate for my current age + retirement portfolio. 
* If I want to add more to retirement contributions, I cannot create an IRA correct? I would have to contribute more thru the new job’s MEBT system? 
* Should I rollover my old job’s 401k to a new broker? Or can I create a roth ira thru that account? It seems like I cannot make one right now through my fidelity account as its still attached to my current job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0k8z9/questions_about_retirement_strategy_for_new_job/,1615222937.0,1,1,0

I just signed a lease for a new place, and for the first time ever, I'll have the option to pay rent digitally using Venmo, Pay Pal, Apple Pay etc. if I want to (bank transfer is also still an option).

I found a 2012 Ford Taurus SEL with slightly over 68,000 miles for $11K. It has less features than my old one but I was willing to have less features if the mileage was low enough.

I don't really drive the Taurus much as it no longer fits my life (I needed a more versatile vehicle). It's 9 years old with nearly 100K so I don't think it's quite worth what I owe. Plus the value has gone down as they stopped making them in 2019. What are my options? It's a great car but I don't really drive it and I need something that works for me better than the Taurus.

592,Best Choice for Saving Money,"Hi All,
I have a question about deciding what to do in regards to saving money and hoping to get some different perspective. 

I currently have a little over $900 in a high yield savings account, the pandemic wiped my savings (not much to start with, like $3000) and I’ve just built this back up. I’m just recently able to save again monthly, I put $150 away each month, a little more here and there when I can. 

I also currently pay on a personal loan from PNC that has a remaining balance of $1600 and an interest rate of 11.74%. With this next stimulus check (assuming we’ll get it and get the $1400) since I’m financially stable now, I was planning to put the whole thing into my savings but now I’m considering if it would be better to put the $1400 towards the personal loan, pay the remaining $200, and then start putting the $155 I pay each month towards the loan into my savings instead. 

Using 10 months as a benchmark (because I have to move in 10 months so I need savings for that), I would have $1550 vs the $1400. So it is more and is technically “growing” because I’ll be adding to it each month. But I am so incredibly terrified of not having the liquid cash of the $1400 off the bat, especially after this year where I had to rely on savings to deal with unemployment, rising costs of living, my car getting totaled, etc.

594,21 years old with $16k - what to do.,"Over the past quarter or so I've been able to earn (and save) a nice amount of money, thankful because I know a lot my age, and some older aren't doing as well.

I live in the UK and don't have much knowledge of banks or savings accounts. I currently have about 85% in a 0.01% gross interest savings account (i know, i know) and the rest in stocks.

* Live with parents for now, cheap cost of living
* I don't go out and spend much 
* Willing to gamble a bit

I'm considering putting $2-3k into a nice ETF that has an upward trend, I figure it's got to be better than letting it sit in my savings.

597,Basics: how does compounded earnings correlates to returns?,"Hi all,I'm trying to understand exactly when compounded earnings/compounded interest can be used as terms and calculations.

Basic example:

* I invest **10.000 as a principal**
* every month I add **1.000 as monthly investments**
* the imaginary asset we invest into doesn't have any dividends but grows exponentially and steadily at the incredible, unheard **rate of 10% every month for 2 years** (let's say a stock or a cryptocurrency).

If I use a calculator such as: [https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php) and I select ""compound interval"" as monthly, I obtain a future investment value of 186,994.65.  
Here is the calculation: [https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/compound?a=10000&p=120&pp=yearly&y=2&m=0&rd=1000&rp=monthly&rt=deposit&rm=end&ci=monthly&ip=&c=2&di=](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/compound?a=10000&p=120&pp=yearly&y=2&m=0&rd=1000&rp=monthly&rt=deposit&rm=end&ci=monthly&ip=&c=2&di=)

Is this a correct calculation or since the asset doesn't have dividends it doesn't make sense to talk about compounding?

598,Where do I put a 50K house deposit I don't need to access for at least 6 years?,"So right now I have a UK government help to buy ISA which I transfer 4K into every year (this is the max) to receive the 25% interest towards a house, and the rest of my deposit was in a fixed rate savings account. However, the savings account dropped to 0.5% interest, so I took it out and I was planning to buy premium bonds because with average luck I would earn double what the 0.5% interest gave me.

What other options do I have given this is my future house deposit (but I won't be buying for probably another 6 years minimum, I'm 20 right now) so I am looking for a low-risk option? It feels like a waste having a large sum sat in such a low-interest account, and bonds aren't much better. Many people are telling me I should invest, but I know nothing about investing (and as a final year student I don't really have the time right now to learn) so I am obviously apprehensive to do this.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, it feels sort of intimidating being a clueless 20-year-old with a relatively large sum and no knowledge of finances, I really don't want to fuck up and I'm possibly overly-cautious about things like stocks&shares ISAs. Is a financial advisor worth it?

609,"Switching Jobs to a Different Retirement Plan, Need advice and have questions"," 

I am switching a job from the private sector to the public sector and will have very different retirement options and wanted to explore the best possible strategies moving forward. I started fulltime at 24 years old so I feel a bit behind in my retirement path. 

**Current Retirement Assets (Age 30)** 

401k: $106k 

HSA: $21k 

No Roth IRA or anything else. 

**Current Job Benefits and Contributions:** 

16% 401k from $82k Salary 

5% 401k match from employer 

$2600 to HSA from myself 

$1000 from employer 

**Annual Total Pre-Tax retirement contribution: $20,820** 

**Future Job Benefits:** 

Salary 98k 

MEBT (401k equivalent) Matches up to 6.2% 

Healthcare: no HDHP – no HSA contributions anymore 

PERS – Pension plan (mandatory, replaces social security)

My goal is to match or increase retirement contributions of previous job of $20,820 a year. 

When exploring the MEBT program, I see that funds are picked for everyone and I have no choice in funds to select. My current 401k is thru fidelity's and we have pretty good selection of funds. Since im young, I have selected aggressive ETF’s and have done well in performance. Upon analyzing the MEBT, the allocation is on the much more conservative side and as a result has vastly underperformed the market (sp500) from 2009 to 2018. For example, 2009 – 2017 the MEBT avged 10.22% returns while Sp500 returned 13.2%, every year was worse in %growth or %loss. As a result, I am more reluctant to contribute more than the minimum 6.2% match through the MEBT 

**Planned Retirement** **Contributions:** 

At minimum, contribute 6.2% to 401k to get full match. 

Start a roth ira and max it out $6k and pick low expense aggressive funds thru a brokerage. 

Adds up to $12,152 pre-tax in 401k a year and $6,000 in post-tax retirement.  

Take into account that the job pays into a pension rather than Social security and the pension plan is vastly superior to my understanding. Example: work 5 years and u get 10% of ur highest average income for the rest of your life after retirement. 10 years= 20%, 20 year = 40%, etc. I plan to stay at minimum 5 years and likely 10-20 years+ 

**Some Questions I had:** 

Do you feel 6.2% contribution and maxing roth IRA is adequate for my current age + retirement portfolio. 

If I want to add more to retirement contributions, I cannot create an IRA correct? I would have to contribute more thru the new job’s MEBT system? 

Should I rollover my old job’s 401k to a new broker? Or can I create a roth ira thru that account? It seems like I cannot make one right now through my fidelity account as its still attached to my current job.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0ayxj/switching_jobs_to_a_different_retirement_plan/,1615190629.0,4,4,0

In the beginning of the year I ran into some health issues and had to get a CT Scan. My insurance isn't that great (high deductible), so I called around my city at different places and asked how much it would cost. One hospital could book me the next day for $700, and while it wasn't the cheapest, it was still a decent price compared to other places I called.

When I get to the hospital, they confirm that I will be paying for it out of pocket, and they charge me the same amount I agreed to over the phone the previous day. They make no mention of other costs. I go in, get my CT Scan done, and go about my life.

Today I get a call that there was an additional ""radiology reading fee"" that I haven't paid and they're going to send it to collections. At no point in my visit did anyone mention any fee. In fact, if they had, I would have told them NOT to issue a radiologist's report because my doctor examined the actual CT Scan output and was going to disregard any radiologist report anyway. My father was with me the day of, and he too confirms that we were never told about any fee.

I have to admit I lost my temper with the lady on the phone and told her I wasn't going to be paying any bills that I never agreed to pay, for a service I never agreed to sign up for (when I walked in I told them I just needed the CD with the images of the CT Scan). What are my options here? They want to charge me an additional $300 and if I had known it was going to be $700 + $300 I would've kept calling around to find another place to get the scan done.

I originally used Betterment because I only had experience with robo-advisors and it seems to be widely regarded as the best one, but people seem to prefer Vanguard for lower fees and I finally decided to hop on.

First thing's first, I already know I did this inefficiently. Since it said it would require paperwork to transfer the account over, I just decided to take the penalty and withdraw my <$500 from Betterment.

Primarily, is there more I could/should be doing in my Vanguard Roth IRA that won't cost me a $3,000 minimum investment?

I’ll outline my rough situation - I file as head of household, 2 dependents, make $15 an hour. This means I already don’t have any federal income tax taken out of my paycheck, which is correct. When I file at the end of the year, my taxable income drops even more due to the (formerly) $2K child tax credits, and I end up getting a refund, even though I had zero tax liability throughout the year. Yup, I am poor enough the government pays me. 

Now, with the expanded child tax credits, they’re talking about it being “monthly” - as in decreasing your monthly tax burden on your paycheck so that you get more take home pay, and then lose the credit at the end of the year. But I already have no monthly burden. Are they (the government) going to literally mail me checks every month for $500, which would be the epxanded credit for 2 kids divided by 12 months?  I really don’t get this for those of us who have no federal tax liability already ....",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0h3lj/eli5_the_new_way_child_tax_credits_are_being_done/,1615214580.0,1,1,0

627,I need help understanding health insurance (US).,"I'm trying to figure out when an HMO vs PPO vs HDHP with an HSA would be most economical. I know that's hard to figure out, so I just want to get an idea of extremes, maybe even ranges. I'm 24 and still thankfully under my parent's health insurance, but I won't have that backup when I'm 26, so I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to do once I'm on my own.

My understanding is HMO costs the most upfront and is restrictive with who you can see but then gives the cheapest services. PPO has more options out-of-network but then has a deductible. HDHP also has more options and has the highest deductible and the option to put in pre-tax dollars into an HSA.

I'm wondering when which type is best. Like, is an HDHP best for someone who just refuses to go to the doctor unless there's an emergency? Is an HMO best for a hypochondriac who wants regular doctors visits? Is it hardest to determine when a PPO is a good idea financially because it's in the middle, and balancing can be hard? 

I'm a hypochondriac I think, so I like having the option to go to the doctor. I also like having access to therapy. Would that make an HMO best for me?

I think I read something here on reddit along the lines of HDHP covering preventative care costs and not requiring the deductible yet.... If that's right, does that mean doctor's checkups are still covered by insurance (with copay) and the deductible is only for emergencies?

I remember reading Freakonomics, and the book mentioning something about how insurance is basically a bad idea economically. Yet we are required to have life insurance, health insurance, car insurance, etc.. I believe that's because typically we're fine and don't need to use that expensive insurance that much anyway. This idea seems to point to the HDHP?

tl;dr Health insurance confuses me. Is HMO basically for hypochondriacs, HDHP for super healthy people, and PPO for people in the middle?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0ghyh/i_need_help_understanding_health_insurance_us/,1615212752.0,1,1,0

640,Father passed away. Not sure how to make the best of his life insurance windfall.,"Hello, my mother, sister, and I (son) are looking for some advice on what to do with a windfall of $400,000 from the passing of my father on December 31, 2021. The money is not taxed.

We were left with a $290,000 mortgage on our home which is valued at around $600,000.

My father did not have any savings and did have debt which we have not paid at all since it was all in his name. My mother has about $4,000 of debt which we do plan on paying off. I have about $20,000 in student loan debt and my sister has about $20,000 in student loan debt that we do not plan on paying off for quite a while as due to COVID, there are delays in place and the interest rate is not high.

**Our current income:**

**Myself**: $40,000 / year job (First job ever, expecting a $5,000 / year raise in 2 months and the average salary for my role is $70,000 in the US which should come to fruition 6 months - 1 year from now. Job security is very comfortable, family friend is employer.)

**Sister**: $200 / week (Still in college for another year. Had a job that laid her off when COVID started. On unemployment now.)

**Rent**: $1650 / month (2 family home, we rent the upstairs.)

**Expenses:**

Our expenses used to be about $5,500 / month when my father was here. We have significantly reduced our monthly expenses to about $4,000 / month and are still actively reducing where we can. Property taxes are a significant portion ($1,200 / month) from where we live.

**Goal:**

Our current goal or plan is to use the windfall to generate income or growth for the future (10+ years from now).

An idea that we have is:

$60,000 Emergency Fund Savings Account

$340,000 Bond/Stock/Mutual Fund Portfolio (not sure what would be best for us here, we do not expect to need the money for at minimum 5 years. We wish to put it somewhere and forget about it for a long time while in the future also adding to it when we earn more income.)

All of my job's income + my sister's unemployment (and future job) to pay the monthly expenses such as groceries, mortgage, utilities, etc. I already have $25,000 in my checking account which I got from selling items online in video games I saved from over the years.

This really hit us by surprise as my father was a really great guy who was not sick/in bad health at all and was always enthusiastic and cheerful to everyone, even strangers. We miss him very much. Even in his death he took care of us to make sure we were going to be okay by having life insurance. We do not want to squander all he did for us and waste the money. We want to make sure we do it right and use this money as a great head start in life, even if it has to be without him.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, we were never rich financially, but my father made us feel rich with his upbeat personality. We are just kind of lost on how to make sure we don't squander this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lzzj18/father_passed_away_not_sure_how_to_make_the_best/,1615150686.0,20,20,0

644,"Brussels Airlines canceled my flight, refund cannot be found","Hello everyone, December of 2019 I purchased an international plane ticket from the US to Europe directly from Brussels Airlines (BA), to depart June of 2020, total cost of US$955. Fast forward through a global pandemic, the flight is obviously canceled. BA offers two options: 1) get a refund of the money paid for the ticket, or 2) reschedule the ticket to a later date and receive a 50€ bonus per passenger. Due to work restrictions and not knowing when we could travel, I decided to go with option 1.

\-I notified BA of my choosing option 1 as soon as the flight was canceled, around May 10, 2020. -On August 5, 2020 I was notified that the refund request has been received.

\-On October 19, 2020 I received notice that the refund has been processed, but I found no activity in the bank account that was used. (For reference, I did find the initial purchase transaction from December of ‘19).

\-I called the refund department, they tell me to wait a few days as international money can take 5-7 days to deposit in an account. Reasonable enough, I decide to wait.

\-the next week, October 27 I begin calling BA to check the status of my refund. Each time I call (I would usually call every 2-3 days) they give me a different answer. Some answers include “only the refund PROCESS has been initiated, but the money has not been released,” “the time for international money transfers can be 5-7 business days,” and my personal favorite red flag, “our systems indicate that your refund has been completed and you should have all the money in your account.”

\-At this point I’m ballistic. I call my bank, verify every detail that a refund transaction has not been initiated by BA, and that the purchase amount from December of ‘19 is still missing from my account.

\-I decide to open a fraud case. I submit a claim, give them all relevant details, and do more waiting.

\-Bank seems to think everything is on my side for this case, grants me courtesy funds. I imagine everything is cleared up and go about my life.

\-NOPE. About a month later they take back the courtesy funds, and inform me that the transaction was in fact legitimate, they have records that I was actually the person to purchase that plane ticket (which wasn’t even the fraudulent part??? Ok).

Now I am in email correspondence with an escalated customer relations agent in BA, who just keeps telling me (Dec 2020, Jan 2021, and Feb 2021) that she has re-escalated my claim and they are looking into it.

Is there anything I can do here? $955 is not a small amount of money, but I don’t know if it’s large enough to get a lawyer involved.

To give you an idea of the growth: in May of 2001 we had around $44,000 (after the 2000 crash), today we have $283,000. Not counting the IRA’s since we didn’t have those back then. 

We’ve not added a lot of money to the main account over the years, so it’s mostly growth, but it’s not done nearly as well as we feel it should have in 20 years with a bull market. There are also a lot more options these days, we are hoping a different company will perform better for us. We’ve been discussing moving a chunk of our funds somewhere else, but there are almost too many options now and we can’t come to an agreement on who to use. 

I’m leaning more towards companies such as Vanguard, Fidelity or Charles Schwab instead of apps like Personal Capital, Betterment or Wealthfront. Since our comfort zone is to invest in mutual funds rather than individual stocks (we’ve been told mutual funds are safer). We’ve also gotten used to having someone else manage things for us. I don’t want to risk screwing it up if we do things ourselves. 

We are in our early 50’s and I feel it’s a security risk to give an app all our financial info so they can track our spending, though my wife likes that idea. She wants to try more than one option rather than putting everything in one place again. I prefer to keep things simple and deal with one entity.

I am also ex-military, we bank with USAA, and they offer investment in mutual funds and ETF’s through Victory Capital, so that’s an option for us too.

We were discussing all this prior to learning about the pending crash/depression and  hyper inflation warning from Michael Burry and other experts, that seems inevitable and soon. Now we are contemplating if we should pull **ALL** our funds out of EJ, not just most and hold onto it until after the crash and then invest with a new company. Though I’m not sure how to “hold onto it” other than the old hiding it under the mattress thing. In the mild crash of ’08 we lost half our funds in EJ and it took 4 years to get back to where we had been. We have more now and it would kill any hopes of retirement if we lost half again. They are projecting this crash will be bigger, so we fully expect to lose more than we did in ’08.  

I know I sound like one of those panicky people wanting to pull on my money out of the bank, but we really can’t afford to lose half our savings again at our age. 

Any recommendations on what company or app to use as well as advice to get through the coming depression as best as possible (Do we hide it under the mattress?), and how to not get taxed too badly from pulling all our money out would all be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0b84u/want_to_leave_edward_jones_and_michael_burrys/,1615191736.0,0,0,0

651,Repairing credit score to buy a house.,"Hi, just looking for some constructive advise. Finances have been an utter mess my whole adult life. I’m now in a job that pays a decent salary, earning bonus has allowed me to pay off 80% of debt and finally starting to pay bills on time. 

My question is, is it possible to get accepted for a mortgage within the next 4 years or do I need to wait for every negative notification on my credit file to drop off?

I’m mid 30’s

I earn £43,000 a year, with an extra £10,000 minimum in bonus.

I have around £4,000 of debt remaining that I am paying off. This will be cleared in 6 months.

I have 2 paid in full CCJ’s (3 years old) on credit file. 

I have under a year to fully pay off my student loans which will give me back an extra £155 a month.

Once debts are gone I’ll be able to save £500 a month, excluding lump sum bonus’ payments.

I’m literally dying to buy a house. All of my friends own houses, many on less household income than I have. I feel embarrassed that I don’t own a place and it seriously gets me down. 

Just wondering if I have a chance of securing a mortgage or whether I have to wait it out and come to the realisation that I can’t buy for another 4 or so years??",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0ea0m/repairing_credit_score_to_buy_a_house/,1615204997.0,1,1,0

I am attempting to create a portfolio for my financial stocks. I would like to create something like this:

[https://ibb.co/SBDJhgs](https://ibb.co/SBDJhgs)

In this case A2 is where I put the ticker, for example, AAPL stands for Apple.  Afterwards, I hope to automatically extract the value of 'Sector"" in cell B2 and ""Industry"" in cell C2. I attempt to create a general formula, so that I can expand the formula for a long list of tickers, instead of creating a unique  xpath for every ticker.

The website from which I attempt to receive the data is:

[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AAPL](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AAPL)

When you scroll downstairs, you will be able to see ""Sector"" and ""Industry"". I want to extract those values, so in case of apple, this would be 'Information Technology' for sector and 'Technology Hardware, Storage and Peripherals'.  See: [https://ibb.co/sCbT801](https://ibb.co/sCbT801)

If I highlight Information technology and copy the x-path I find this:

//\*\[@id=""companyProfile""\]/div\[8\]/span/a

So then I try the following formula, but receive an error:

=IMPORTXML(""[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AAPL"";""//\*\[@id=""companyProfile""\]/div\[8\]/span/a](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AAPL"";""//*[@id=""companyProfile""]/div[8]/span/a)"")

However, this one seems to be working:

=IMPORTXML(""[https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AAPL"";""/html/body/table/tbody/tr/td\[4\]/table\[2\]/tbody/tr/td\[1\]/div\[3\]/div\[8\]](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/evaluate/snapshot.jhtml?symbols=AAPL"";""/html/body/table/tbody/tr/td[4]/table[2]/tbody/tr/td[1]/div[3]/div[8])"")

But it gives me the ""sector"" AND ""information technology"" and I only wish to receive the information technology.

Furthermore, I would like it to use this formula ideally, but it also gives back an error:

Unfortunately my father died last week and am beneficiary on his investment account with a major private investment firm.

I’ll be talking to his financial advisor next week... but what I would like to do is keep the 401k and stocks somehow invested with them for my retirement and continue access to the $120k via checking like it currently is to pay off around $8k of personal debt and keep it accessible for house needs and emergencies.

I have loans from this year that I ended up not needing.

Is it unethical/illegal to use the refund from my newer loans to pay off the earlier loan? Or should I just refund the newer loans and worry about the earlier loan normally?

If it's not illegal, it would make more sense for me to pay off the earlier loan because of the higher interest rate + it has a slightly larger principal amount, but I imagine it's a bit sketchy territory.

663,33 yo starting to panic about retirement,"Came across the financial advice on the dashboard of my retirement accounts that I should have saved up twice my yearly salary by 35 years of age. I am panicking as I am far behind this estimate.

I am in the beginning of year 3 out of my 30 year mortgage for a relatively small inexpensive home at 5% interest.

Saved perhaps 1x salary in 401k (non-Roth) enough to hit employers match fully plus 1%, an emergency fund of 3-6 months and spent last year at a reduced income and doing home improvements taking away dead trees, getting tools for the house (still need things like a ladder/workbench, as well as furniture to replace the terrible particle board bookcases and such. So house poor in a sense.

I calculated a monthly take home after withholding just enough for taxes, cost of the mortgage, maintaining and insurance for 2 old cars, dogs, groceries, even determined what I am spending a month for my hobby. I feel that the estimate is off by a few hundred for miscellaneous needs but think I could save comfortably 500/month.

My fear is having access to said savings for when in a few years I can replace cars and pay for the major expenses like landscaping, water heater, furnace, concrete driveway that I can see will be on the horizon.

This leads me to ask if it makes sense to pay additional to mortgage vs saving with a brokerage account for these inevitable expenses.

I have only begun my journey but based on my limited understanding prefer on principles DRIP ETF or bonds as these seem to have a realistic value to them whereas the VTI style seems to be growth by cannabalizing assets at the right time or playing a market game which seems inherently less ethical and more volatile. I don’t care for materials even when they have a true catalytic nature to them that can not easily be superseded by lighter elements.

I am scheduling an appointment with the financial advisor attached to my accounts that I was unaware of when opening with a company.

My questions:
What books do you recommend to explain the financial world we live in?

Is the blanket statement valid 2x salary by 35 true especially since I have reached my limit of potential and will actively avoid going higher in responsibilities at work/job title?

Will a Drip etf be enough?

What are safe assumptions for inflation vs growth?

What would be good to know to avoid being at the mercy of a financial advisors own corporate agenda?

Any advice in general on where to keep at it for the steep learning curve?

1. Apps are not gonna work for me. I've tried a couple and I just dislike them. The categories are wrong so often that I would rather just enter everything myself.

I was away from home for a month and was only just now able to come back and open my mail. I quit my job last November due to an emergency move in with a family member and have been in quarantine on my savings ever since. 

Got a letter from my employer stating that I am eligible to withdraw money from my... ESOP account? Stock Ownership Plan. And that I can do so from Feb 9 to Mar 9 to select an option - Move the money into an IRA, roll the assets to another employers retirement plan, or take the money in cash and pay taxes on it. It says after this date, if my vested balance is below $5,000 (which it is), it may be automatically distributed based on the Plan's force out provisions. 

I checked my plan online and the only option it lists is ""Cash (rollover and/or payout). I suppose that includes all three of those options in one? Not sure.

I was automatically opted into the company's stocks and I'm not really sure how this works. I have a 401k with this company as well, there's a large possibility I'll re-employ with them once I get the vaccine now that I'm in another different town with locations here, so I'm not sure if I could/should keep this retirement account and if I can put the stocks in there, or if I should just make an IRA either way and... Put the stocks and my 401k investments in there? Stocks are about $900, 401k is about $3000. If it's relevant, I make about $20,000 a year and don't foresee making much more in the next few years.

672,Should I just rent forever?,"I live in a HCOL area (San Francisco), and my rent is way cheaper than I'd be able to pay for a house.

Currently my rent is 2.5k/month. SF also has rent control, meaning my rent can only increase by ~2% per year. This is a great value for SF as many places similar to mine rent for 3-4k+

To buy a similar place would mean spending at least $1m. The median home price is $1.5m for a very simple, average house.

If I wanted to go the condo route, a dirt cheap studio condo would run something like 600k. And would be much smaller than what I currently am renting.

Given this, it's there any point in ever buying a house? It seems like I'd be financially better off renting forever and just investing my extra saved money elsewhere.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m0bw9u/should_i_just_rent_forever/,1615194657.0,1,1,0

674,Statement vs Current Balance?,"I am somewhat new to the credit card world. I've had my credit card for just over a year now. I have never missed a payment and always pay my current balance in full before it's due. However, I was unaware of what a statement balance is and how it affects my credit score.

I was always told to never have a balance, but I assumed that meant just making sure I pay my bill in full. I didn't know it also meant not having a statement balance. I've had a statement balance of anywhere from $20-30 the past few months.

I am aiming to maximize my credit score. I am currently at 745, and while I think that's really good, I would like to do what I can to get it higher. So should I be making sure I don't have a statement balance going into the new month? From what I've read this means I pay my current balance a few days before my bill is due and not using my credit card until the new period begins?

I'd like to replace the home entirely.

I have three credit cards, and I ALWAYS pay the balance in full every month.

a) every day card - everything I can charge that isn’t an auto debit. varies 1,000 to 2,500 depending on month. Cc limit is 35k.

b) monthly charge card: monthly autodebit (car insurance, cell phone, etc) usually 300 or so monthly. Cc limit is 10,000

c) hotel branded card. Only for hotel stays and incidentals. Varies 200-800 depending. Limit is 8k.

total cc limit: 53k. Highest monthly usage: 5000 (rare), which is still <10% utiliztiom.

my car loan was paid off at least 1 year before the score dropped. I have no mortgage.

I have no delinquent/collections on my record

i have no other debt. This is the only thing I can identify as the cause - I paid off the last my grad student loans in summer 2019, and the last of my undergrad loans in late summer 2020. is my credit score now penalized because I have no installment debt?

Sounds pretty standard, I’ve met the landlord in person and he seems like a genuinely honest guy, and he’s shown me the place himself, he is a professor at a university which I have verified, have gone out of my way to verify that the property he will be renting out to me is under his name. And everything checks out! I’ve spoken to a previous tenant who claims the landlord is amazing and yeah honestly no issues I have come across with the landlord. 

I however can’t shake the feeling to not want to give the landlord my SSN through an email rental application on a pdf. It’s nothing personal against the landlord I just feel like the less I need to share that kind of information the better if that makes sense. There are sites like cozy.com which allow for the landlord to send me an link for screening where I can put in my SSN myself and both he and I receive the credit background checks all without having to pass sensitive information to one another. I dunno I feel uneasy about putting my SSN on a pdf through an email, just something about it makes me feel not safe lol idk how else to put it. 

I’ve brought my concerns to the landlord about sharing my SSN and he has gone out of his way to do things like offering to add onto the lease a portion about promising to delete my information whenever the lease terminates. Like I said the guy has very positive vibes. And it seems like he wants to make me not worry as much. I really like him and I like the place he’s renting out and so I don’t want to come off as super paranoid to him.  So I guess my question is at what point should I relax about my personal security lol.

TlDr: I'm about to get paid my annual bonus (9k) and need to decide whether to pay down my debt or contribute to Roth IRA 2020. Looking for advice on what makes the most sense

Option A - Put 6k for Roth IRA 2020 and increase emergency fund by 3k: I'm inclined to take this path due to the flexibility of withdrawing the funds if I want and also using this tax advantaged benefit. I will eventually retire on my home country but plan to stay in the US for the next 5-10 years at least. Would like to have as much money on hand as possible if I need/want to go back before that.

Option B - Use 9k to pay back debt: I see my student debt as a ""tax"" that allowed me to increase my salary by ~5-10x so I don't mind paying the ~1k per month although I understand that every dollar put to debt saves me the 5.75% interest. Paying back debt doesn't reduce my monthly payments, only reduces the number of future payments. Not able to refinance yet due to my immigration status. I'd rather have the flexibility of cash and hand in case something happens than to pay back debt. My plan is to pay a large sum once my company has a liquidity event (should happen in less than 2 years) that allows me to cash my options.

A bit more info about me: 34 y/o international, came to the US in 2017 and have been working since 2019 after I finished my master. Currently making 140k + bonus + equity in a HCOL, sole breadwinner for my wife and 1.5 y/o son. I have 135k in student debt at a 5.75% rate (variable) on a 25 year term - currently paying $900 a month. ~35k in HYSA as emergency fund and ~15k in 401k (no match, putting $600 a month) + 9k in my home country invested in bonds/ stock market + 1k in Roth IRA ($500 a month, on track to 6k for 2021). Saving between 1K-2K a month which have been going to my HYSA, now that I have a solid emergency fund will look into paying back debt more aggressively.

A few years into owning this thing which we rarely used we were asked to attend an owner's weekend package and got to stay for free as they explained how things were changing.  They explained that our every other year week would be useless to trade unless we converted our investment into points with RCI and we would then be way better off if we upgraded to every year equivalent for RCI points.  It cost us a new mortgage of 8K.  Soon after that I got sick with Cancer and discovered this whole timeshare thing was a scam.  Much if not everything they said was a lie.    
I decided to stop paying the mortgage and eventually tried to hire a Timeshare lawyer to remove us from the contract.  Long story short they got them to stop the harassing phone calls and nasty letters.  I eventually recovered from Cancer but I'm now currently disabled.  The lawyer got us to quit claim deed back to them.  They never contested it until 6 months later and said they were nullifying the deed being returned.  Our lawyer fought and it seems on paper we no longer own it.     
The problem is they continue reporting 120-day late on my credit reports for well over the past 18 months.  The credit agencies won't let me dispute it because we tried more than once.  Does anyone know of any options we have to get them to stop reporting these late's on our credit.  Can they just keep reporting this forever?  Every month is a new late entry on our credit.

- Starting salary: 125k yearly (~82k after-tax). No 401k matching

- Liquid Savings: ~4k cash

- Invested: 11k in stocks

- No debt

- After-tax, rent, utilities, food: ~43k free cash flow for year 1

I'm trying to enter in my IRA activity into HR Block's online tax prep and just want to be sure that I'm doing things right. Here's the details of what I'm planning to do:

* My spouse and I have traditional and Roth IRA's through Vanguard. These are separate from our employer retirement plans. The traditional IRA's we've been contributing to since 2018, but none of those contributions have ever been tax deductible due to my spouse and I being high earners. The Roths we of course have not made any contributions to since our shift to being high earners.
* We just made our $6k contribution for tax year 2020 a couple weeks ago.
* After learning about the magic trick of a backdoor Roth, I plan to convert the entirety of our Vanguard traditional IRA's to the existing Roth's shortly.

A few questions regarding this process:

* Do I need to report this conversion for tax year 2020 at all?
* Are there any tax implications for tax year 2021? All of our contributions to the traditional IRA's have been non-deductible, so I think no based on my reading, but are the gains since inception taxed?
* Do I need to put this anywhere in HR Block for tax year 2020?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m040wl/backdoor_roth_reporting_question/,1615164824.0,2,2,0
722,Mortgage Docs show higher rate than quoted by lender,"Silly question... My spouse and I are under contract to purchase a new home. We have a local bank that we like and have our current mortgage through them. Once we had a signed purchase agreement on the new house, we worked with our loan officer to lock in a rate. Initially he had quoted us via email 2.75% + closing costs or 2.875% + no closing costs. We opted to go with the lower 2.75% + closing costs. After I sent the email, he called me and explained that the 2.75% was for a 60 day rate lock and since we were closing in just under 75 days, the best rate he could do was 2.875% + closing costs or 3% with no closing costs. At this time, rates were climbing so we bit the bullet and told him to lock on 2.875% (via phone call) versus waiting until we hit the 60 day window. 

I just got the docs in the mail this weekend to sign and they show 3% + closing costs. 

I’ve sent him a follow up email to determine if this is an error, but what are my options if he claims that it is not? Are we locked into this loan or can we walk away and secure financing with another lender? I know I’m splitting hairs on an eighth of a percent, but I’m annoyed it doesn’t align with what he told me. We don’t close until May, but obviously don’t want to mess up anything with the purchase of our new home.

725,[HCOL] Condo Now or Home in 3-5 Years,"Hello! Thank you ahead of time for any advice!

My partner (27F) and I (27M) live in a HCOL area/state (e.g., SF) and will likely settle permanently in CA (her family is in Bay Area; mine is in SoCal).

**Condo Assumptions** \-- Given low inventory in the market, interest rates, and current down payment savings/income, it seems like we can only really afford a condo, assuming \~$700k + 15% above ask allotment and $1k/month HOA (down payment of $235k).

**Home Assumptions** \-- Assuming no increase in compensation from 2021 levels, saving rate consistent with historical levels, and 3.0% blended return on current down payment portfolio, I think we could have \~$800k for a down payment in \~5 years. Given current Bay Area prices and inflation, I'm thinking that could support a $1.5M house in 2026 dollars (something like a 1.5k/sqft house in Sunset or 2.5k/sqft house in East Bay). Monthly payment seems like it would be around \~$6k in 2026 dollars (assuming interest rate of 6%).

* **Combined Annual Income** \-- $315k in 2020; $360k for 2021; $460k for 2022 (excludes equity) ($110k of 2021 levels is in an annual bonus that has paid out at 100% levels for the last 5 years; 2022 bonus mix likely to be $185k of $460k)
* **Monthly Post-Tax/401(k) Take Home (excluding bonus)** \-- \~$11k for 2021; \~$13k for 2022
* **Current Non-Emergency Fund / Non-Retirement Savings** \-- $235k
* **Debt** \-- $0
* **Current Rent / Expenses** \-- $3.7k/month for rent; \~$5k/month all other expenses (includes amortization of all non-monthly costs like vacation/car maintenance/etc.)
* **Future One Time Income** \-- Expecting between $90k-$180k in pre-tax proceeds from business investment within 3-5 year period (historical average payout would yield $135k) 
* **Future One Time Expenses** \-- \~$100k general allocation for wedding/car in next 5 years
* **Kids** \-- at least +5 years out

**Question**: is it worth buying a condo in SF to take advantage of low interest rates (albeit higher price), or just wait for a single family home in \~5 years?

729,How should I play my retirement accounts in my situation,"I'm a 22 year old trying to get finances in place. I made 126k last year (due to capital gains mainly) and am expecting 120K+ income this year due to a job I am starting this month and more capital gains. I am trying to figure out if a traditional IRA or backdoor Roth IRA is the best choice for me. Some background:

* I *believe* I am eligible for the tax deduction from traditional ira contributions since I currently don't have a 401k or anything similar. (I say believe because I will be starting my job at the end of this month which will offer a 401k plan that I will contribute to, so not sure if that will make it where I can no longer receive the deduction).
* I expect to contribute via a backdoor Roth IRA in the near future due to income limits.
* Since I made 126k last year the amount that I can contribute to a Roth IRA gets phased out so I made it simple and am only looking at the traditional IRA and backdoor Roth IRA options.
* The 401k plan can be traditional or roth, so some guidance on which one I should choose there is appreciated.

Since the deduction is possible in my understanding, which would be the best option? Thanks.

Also extra question: my 401k plan can include contributions via IRA rollover, so is it possible to take the deduction from the traditional ira, rollover the traditional ira to my soon-to-be work 401k then use the backdoor roth ira as my future ira contribution method without worrying about the pro-rata rule?

736,How to divide expenses with roommate?,"Hello everyone, thank you in advance for your advice.

My roommate and I have been friends for several years, and are very alike: both are vegans with pretty much the same food tastes, work in extremely similar niche jobs, have the same animals, neither of us watch TV, and both of us are extremely private in that we do not like people in our house, with rare exceptions. 

They are more mellow than me, but very chill and a good communicator. We are great match for roommates. 

This is, however, my first time ever rooming with someone, and I am not sure how to split the groceries (which we are - it is just more economical to do so, as we literally buy the same things.) 

I was thinking about doing a spreadsheet, but it doesn't make much sense. 

Should we do a google doc and keep rack of each thing we buy? split expenses at the end of the month or as they come up? just generally add up and divide it, sparing our own snacks/personal stuff? I am open to suggestions!

740,$500 for kids - what to do with it?,"When my kids were baptized (they are twins), their godparents made them the gift of $500 each. At the time we were living a very paycheck to paycheck existence, and we needed to use the money for basic household expenses/car repairs, things like that. But I always felt extremely guilty about it and vowed that when I could, I would replace it. 

So now that I can, I’m wondering what’s the best thing to do with the money. Some options I’ve considered:

-stick it into their 529 accounts
-stick it into their saving accounts. (I have youth saving accounts for them at my local credit union which pays an amazing 6.00 APY on the first $1000 in their accounts and then 0.15 on any balance above $1k, until their 18th bdays.)
-Buy a Treasury or Savings Bond (Admittedly I know very little about these.)

They are currently 4 years old if that makes any difference in the advice that you give. 

Their savings accounts currently each have about $200 in them. I transfer $2 to each of them each week, and every three months I go in person to deposit whatever birthday/Christmas/grandparents sent a card with $5 in it type money. 

I’m also open to other options besides what I’ve listed above. I thought about doing Roth IRAs,  but they’re too young to show any earned income.

744,Do you need to invest in your state's 529 plan?,"I am trying to put money in a 529 plan and am finding it confusing. I assumed I could just set up a 529 through Vanguard, where I have all my other investments, but it looks like I need to do it through my state (New York) in order to get the state tax deduction.

Is that the case? Or can I set up a 529 with any brokerage and still get the deduction? Vanguard does have 529 funds, but if I am reading the information correctly, I can't deduct my investment if I use one of those as opposed to the one run directly by New York.

Is this true, and if so, why do the states do it that way? Wouldn't it be cheaper and easier for them to let brokerages run their own 529s and have people invest that way?

I'm asking these questions partly because I'm trying to figure out whether a 529 is worth it. The fact that the states seem to want to force you to go through these hoops, and pay fees to a 529 plan that they administer, makes me slightly more suspicious of the whole idea of a 529 -- which already seems like not an excellent deal given the uncertainty of whether my kids will actually go to college, and the relatively short investment timeline (we're only about 15 years out from the first one going to college, which is on the short side for confidently investing in stocks). I'm also not excited about having yet another account to keep track of. I would prefer to keep all my investments centralized in Vanguard.

745,Uncashed EE bonds from 1988-2000 tax implications,"I was recently told that my parents bought EE bonds for me between the years of 1988 and 2000.  Obviously the bonds from 1988-1990 have reached final maturity and are no longer earning interest.  I have read that tax is due on the interest in the years they reach final maturity, so tax would be due in 2018, 2019, and 2020.  However, I have not cashed any out and have not paid any tax.

What is the best way to go about this?  If I cash the 1990 bonds tomorrow (in 2021), can I report the interest as income for tax year 2020?  What if I don't get a 1099 before tax day?  And what do I do about the bonds from 1988 and 1989?

To further confound the situation, I expect my marginal tax rate will increase for tax year 2021 from 12% to 22%. The bonds that are still earning interest are making as much as 4%.  Can these/should these be cashed out immediately and claimed as 2020 income?  My thought is that the bonds that will mature in the next few years will not make an additional 10% in interest, so to pay an additional 10% tax I would actually be losing money. Is this correct?

\~$500 for food/utilities/etc.

\-Am I saving enough? I got the studio apartment mainly out of covid concerns, and am open to a roommate or two in the future  
\-What should I be saving for? Is an apartment/house (in the distant future) the best investment, or should I be putting money into stocks? Or something else? I have no guidance here and don't know where to start.  
\-My main concern right now is handling my student loan debt. I currently have a 7% interest rate and am on year 2 of the PSLF. Should I stick with that or refinance?

762,recharacterizing roth ira contribution and retroactively filing form 8606 questions,"hi all, have some questions regarding an unusual situation with my ira basis. some background:

at the start of 2019, i had a job where i earned less than the ceiling for contributing to a roth ira. i used my 2018 tax return and some savings to make the max $6000 contribution all at once and bought some index funds. 

later in 2019, i got a new job earning much more. by the end of 2019 i had earned enough to put me over the contribution limit for roth ira. 

when i did my taxes for 2019, i realized this, and contacted vanguard to recharacterize. they did their thing and they moved $6321 into my traditional ira. this was the $6000 post tax dollars from my original contribution plus the $321 in earnings that occurred over the time period before we caught and corrected this (they told me that they have some kinda formula for this one their end). 

i then made my $6000 contribution for 2020 and then rolled the $12,321 into my roth ira (backdoor style). 

i received two 1099Rs in january 2021. one for $6321 which has the status code R and a taxable amount at $0. the other for $12,321 has status code 2 and a taxable amount of $12,321. 

now most of these dollars were already contributed post tax, but i don’t seem to have a record of any basis since i did not file a form 8606 for my 2019 taxes. (i didn’t think i needed to as i had never done that before with only having contributed to a roth historically)

i believe the correct course of action is as follows:

1) retroactively file a form 8606 for the $6,000 contribution in 2019 that was later recategorized

2) file a form 8606 with my 2020 taxes for the $6,000 i contributed then rolled over

3) report a $6,000 basis, plus my $6,000 contribution in my dedications section in turbo tax when i file my 2020 taxes

4) report the $321 difference as income and pay taxes on it for 2020


does this seem like the correct approach?

763,Looking for guidance on how to address accounts in collections,"\*\* I understand this subreddit does not provide legal advice, and understand that any advice here is personal advice, and that consulting an attorney is still recommended :) I have read the FAQ and still have some questions, hoping I can get some ideas from you all!

**Backstory:**

My partner (40F) has had challenging life events that left her credit basically in shambles. In 2013, she filed for bankruptcy, but even after that made poor decisions that left her with a credit score just north of 500. We were able to pay off her credit cards and get her auto loan current, but that only brought her score up to 572. She lost her job when COVID hit, and has been unable to find new work in the time since. She has, in the last year, maxed out her two cards and missed payments on those and her auto loan (83% on time, currently), bringing her back to her previous score. We're looking at buying a house together, and while we may just have a family member join in the loan instead, would like to do it as a couple. My credit score is currently around 809, though I expect it to temporarily drop to about 791 with a large purchase I just made. We live in California.

**Situation:**

She has 9 medical debts, with one about 19 months old and the rest ranging in age from 36 to 65 months, that were sold to Progressive Management Systems (PMS) from 3 different hospitals in the area. These debts keep getting added to by PMS; they have tacked on $162 to these balances just since September 2020. The sum of these debts under the reported ""Highest balance"" according to our free credit monitoring was $2087, but now the total reported by PMS is $2818.

She also has a supposedly 10 month old debt from ""06 Automobile Club"" which was sold to AWA Collections, who is doing the same thing of raising the balance over time. She states she never had a credit card or debt to AAA, whom we assume is the ""06 Automobile Club"". For the life of us, we cannot figure out where that came from.

**Current Plan/Questions:**

For the debts with PMS: Because some of the accounts are fairly old and beyond the SOL of 4 years in CA, we believe it would either be best to ignore those debts and run out the clock or only proceed with a ""Pay for Delete"" (P4D). However, my research indicates that the ""Pay for Delete"" approach may be outdated, and might not really help. For the remaining debts, they are fairly low dollar amounts and wouldn't be too hard to pay off; but again, is P4D worth pursuing for those? Is there a benefit to negotiating a lower amount and having PMS agree to mark them as paid in full? Would acknowledging a newer debt with PMS also restart the clock on any of the older ones? Is it legal for them to be raising the dollar amount on these collections like they have been? Ultimately our goal is to get her credit score up over 620.

The AWA collections one we plan on challenging; we're planning on either sending a debt verification letter or making a recorded call (2-party consent state FTL) to request all the information. I'd prefer quick/easy/free via phone, but would a letter be any better? It seems that AWA was sued over this exact thing about 3-4 years back and settled out of court in Porter V AWA Collections.

Also open to other helpful ideas/thoughts! We're working on the basic stuff but this is my first time dealing with the dark side of the credit world.

Right now I have about 13k left on my loan for my 2017 wrx.

Our hope is in a year or so to have our first child. Currently my wrx payments are 447 and I’d really like to reduce those to start saving some money. Additionally while the wrx is a sedan I could use more space once we have a child.

I’m trying to figure out my best option to start saving. Based on the 56k miles my car has, it’s worth around $18,000. That gives me some trade in value to reduce the financing costs.

One of my big issues is I absolutely love driving manual and they really don’t have any manual cars for sale anymore that fit the bill. The only one is a 2022 Bronco but with 4 doors that hits around 36k which is going to put me at a similar payment as I have now.

I suppose I could lease for 3-4 years and then reevaluate where I’m at? Is that a terrible idea?

Do I just need to get past the idea that I’m going to be able to drive a manual car and pick something else? There are some nice preowned 4-door trucks around that I could financing around $250-300 per month but they’re all automatic.

773,Calculating current effective tax rate and swagging future income needs/rates.,"Been thinking about what my current rate is versus retirement rates, since everyone says ""Oh invest in a 401k and you'll get to pay taxes on the lower tax bracket when you retire"".   Well, I'd like to start getting an idea of what that tax rate actually would be to help drive decision making. 

My income is from wages, but my reportable income include RSUs for which my company sells shared to hold 30% taxes.  Stocks a real climber, so those shares sold for tax have cost me real opportunity.  Unfortunately the brokerage said that's set by company policy and I can't pay that tax in cash : (   My EOY stubs reflect those RSUS.   I also have some unintended cap gains and dividends from my funds in my cash accounts. 

When I looked at my 2019 Fed, and divided my total tax owed into my AGI it comes out around .17. 
For my State and Local it's another .07 for a combined effective rate of .24.   Does this seem about right for a high earner ? 

To determine what my future taxes may be (of course legislation can change any of this) I realize I need to know what I'm currently spending. In the past I tried using budgets, Mint etc for this and it was like chasing mice through a barn.   For the last several years I've been saving aggressively pre-take-home via ESOP and a 401k, and we live entirely on the take home to include all of our debt servicing (just a mortgage that's pretty small for my area), operational expensive, vacation, topping off the tax payments and any additional saving.   We've been living this way for a couple of years now just fine, even with some advanced out of pocket medical (the big C and *all* the associated long term costs), but at the same time without extreme amounts of left overs.  This is in stark contrast to the past where I had significantly more take-home, but was doing more saving from the take-home.  I feel like now my actual post-tax, post-everything take-home is a pretty good representation of what we spend.   For clarity, I'm saving over 35 a year in the ESOP plus a maxed 401, so I am genuinely saving hard.

So to calculate this, instead of using my pay stubs I was thinking of using my actual EOY direct deposit slip, since that's our take home and our actual expenditures.  This would not include the RSUs or the 401k for example, neither of which I would have in retirement.  I WILL have plenty of medical insurance expenses though, so I would take that number from my EOY pay stuff, and add it into (at 2x) my EOY take home.   This should give me what we're spending now (with older and expensive kids in the house, mind you, so like definitely the highest cost of groceries, eating out, fuel consumption vehicle insurance, vacation etc) plus what I'll need for med insurance in the future.   

I can do this for say 2-3 years worth to get a decent average, and then just run them through the published brackets to get an idea of what my post-retirement effective tax rate would be.  

Does this seem logical ?  Anyone seen any better models for this ? I'm sure they are out there.  Thank you !",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m03xq2/calculating_current_effective_tax_rate_and/,1615164530.0,1,1,0
774,What can we afford? Las Vegas Housing Edition,"Hey Folks,  


I know these posts are done to death, but I am a first time homebuyer and want to make sure I am doing this correctly. I (29) and my wife (30) have a pretax income of about $100k. We have $70k in savings and plan to do 5% down on a conventional loan. We both work government jobs with a great pension (also, do not have to pay into Social Security). In addition I save about $100 into a 403(b) each check. We plan to ramp that up to 15% of my income and do the same for my wife once we close on a house. We have a trivial amount of student loan debt (less than $5k) that I think we are just going to pay off once forbearance is done. Credit scores are excellent (780 for me, about 800 for her) and have no other debt other than maybe $1k on a CC we pay off each month.   


Sites like nerd wallet put our comfortable purchasing power in the $550k range, and we have been flirting with homes between $450k and $500k. Part of me feels like that seems right, but I can't get over these alarm bells saying that I am making a grave mistake. We originally planned to buy closer to $350k in a starter home, but at $450k - $500k we are finding homes we imagine we will literally never have to move out of (at the very least we would be comfortable for 15+ years). Monthly payment at $450k would be about 30% of our pretax income.   


All of this lines up right? We are thrifty elsewhere (namely vehicles which I pride myself on buying beaters and maintaining myself). I also teach and have Summers off, and plan to pick up a Summer job of some sort, which might maybe pull in an extra $5 - 10k or so, if that.   


Are we doing this right? Or am I missing something big? We really want to take advantage of the low interest rates now before they start to get driven back up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lzs3cs/what_can_we_afford_las_vegas_housing_edition/,1615128682.0,5,5,0

When I started with the job I just left, I opened a 403b and have been contributing regularly (and worked there long enough for their match to vest). Last week, I started a new job, but I can't open a 401k with them until July 2022. So in terms of what to do next, I'm thinking:

* Roll over my existing 403b into a traditional IRA (to avoid the taxes of converting it to a Roth); I'd invest it but not continue contributing to it
* Open a Roth IRA, and begin regularly contributing to that
* In July 2022, I'll open a 401k with my employer, as they have a pretty generous benefit (15% annual payment into the account, four-year vesting). The benefit is a contribution, not a match, so I probably wouldn't contribute to it myself and just continue using my Roth IRA.

779,How to calculate the interest rate from a car lease contract,"https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/boardacts/1997/19970327/forms.pdf  

The above is a standard car lease agreement form. When you lease a car, this is the form you will sign. Unfortunately, the form itself doesn't disclose the interest rate/APR/money factor. But I'll show you how to calculate the interest rate and compare against money factor/APR using the example from https://www.edmunds.com/car-leasing/calculate-your-own-lease-payment.html

If we fill out the above contract form using edmunds example, here are the values for page 1 middle section (the key part):  
Gross capitalized cost = $22,200   
Capitalized cost reduction = 2,200   
Adjusted Capitalized Cost = $22,200 - $2,200 = **$20,000**  
Residual Value = **$13,110**  
Depreciation and any Amortized Amounts = $20,000 - $13,110 = $6,890    
Rent Charge = $1,490.04  
Total of Base Monthly Payments = $6,890 + $1,490.04 = $8,380.04  
Lease Payments = **36** months  
Base Monthly Payment = **$232.78**  
Monthly Sales/Use Tax = $23.86  
Total Monthly Payment = $232.78 + $23.86 = $256.64    

This means you are borrowing $20k today to purchase the car. For 36 months, you will pay $232.78/month in advance. After 36 months, your loan balance is $13,110. If you pay this balance, the car will be yours, Instead, if you return the car, the lease will expire. To calculate the interest rate, we can use =RATE() in Excel using the 4 bold numbers.

      = RATE(36, -232.78, 20000, -13110, 1) * 12 = 3.015%  

Note that this interest rate is slightly different from APR implied by the money factor. Edmunds used 0.00125 money factor, multiplied by 2400, we get 3.000% APR (slightly smaller than 3.015%). 

The money factor nor APR is not disclosed in the contract, either. From the contract, you can infer the money factor by 1,490.04 / ($20k + $13,110) = 0.00125. And APR = money factor * 2400 = 3.000%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m03ba8/how_to_calculate_the_interest_rate_from_a_car/,1615162449.0,1,1,0

790,Should I fix my deck before selling? Confusing situation:,"So long story short, my husband is going to apply to law school in a few months to start in August 2022. We bought a house in July 2019. We are thinking about potentially selling after he finishes the first year and me and the kids moving to the city he will be in school in with him.

We believe it would be cheaper for me and our 3 kids to stay in our current city as the new city is more expensive. He will stay in dorms and rolling the cost into student loans. Personal financial info below:

We owe $219,000 on house. Bought it for $229,000.
I make $40,000 ($2600 per month take home)
Bills are currently $3400 per month.
I start a 2nd job making $17 per hour for 48 hours per pay period (2 weeks) in a week to save more money.

The roof on our current house is 17 years old but in amazing shape.

The back deck on the house is rotting. It will either need to be replaced or we will have to make concessions on the house when selling.

Basically my question is should we use the stimulus money ($7000) to redo the deck as a selling point for the house or should we just make some concessions for the new buyer? We might need to make concessions for the roof anyway so we may need to just up it for the deck?

We believe we can list it for around $260,000 if the housing market keeps increasing like it is. Thats a big if though.

Our other option is to just stay put and wait it out for the three years. We are considering this but we'd like to be together as a family.

793,I want to know if I can realistically afford a house,"I make $750 a week ($616 net). I have $135k in savings. I want to buy a house anywhere from $155-185k, and put down about $65-70k of my savings toward the down payment. That should put me about $650-700 a month for housing expenses with property tax and insurance.

My health insurance is about $366 a month and my car insurance costs $150. My cell phone is $36, electric should be around $70 and water $20, internet about $60 (I don't want/need TV). I estimate about $250 for food and $80 a month for gas.

I also want to contribute $500 towards a retirement fund off the top.

So with all that leaves me around $427 a month leftover. I know all kinds of things can come up like doctor appointments, car and home repairs and other things.

But is $427 a month leftover after considering $500 going to retirement bad, or good?

One big thing is I can gross up to around another $700 a month in bonuses, and usually I do make that full amount, but sometimes it can be less, so I figure I should not include that in my monthly expenses. But obviously it's a big difference to the picture.

Also ATM I have a $209/month car payment that I owe $6500 on but I would probably pay it off before I buy a house.

I'm just wondering if you were in my situation would you buy a house now or would you be saying ""no way!""

794,In-laws offering to buy mobile home and help with renovations,"Hello all!

Some background and context:
* My wife and I (no kids) live in a 1 bedroom apartment in a HCOL city
* In-laws moved to different state over two years ago
* Sister-in-law wanted to move back to our city to finish college
* To help out, we offered to have her live with us, but this would mean we would need a bigger place

A few other things to keep in mind:
* My in-laws are probably going to retire in the next 10-15 years and would ideally like to retire in the city where we currently are
* My wife and I would like to own a home someday, but need to save for at least another 5 years before we can realistically start shopping for a home

After some deliberation with everyone, we came to the following solution:
* My in-laws would like to put a sizeable down payment (at least half) on a mobile home and spend some money fixing it up
* Sister-in-law and us would be able to live in the mobile home for more or less as long as we want, up until it's time for my in-laws to retire
* Mobile home would eventually become my in-laws' retirement home

The idea here is that this would help with SIL's living situation, help my in-laws secure a retirement home in our city, and help my wife and I keep our housing costs low so that we can continue to save for a house of our own!

Now, here's the part I have a question about.

As mentioned previously, my in-laws are able and willing to put down a sizeable down payment (at least half) on a mobile home, but would still need to take out a loan to cover the rest of the cost of the purchase. Due to unfortunate circumstances though, neither of them have decent credit and, as such, are concerned about being able to secure a loan. My mother-in-law recommended having my wife co-sign for the loan with my father-in-law to help improve the chances of getting a loan approval.

Besides the obvious of being responsible for the loan as a cosigner, are there any other drawbacks we haven't considered?

My wife and I do plan to stay in the mobile home for as long as possible, even after we've secured enough money to buy our own home. Because we plan to stay so long, that means we also anticipate having most, if not all, of this possible loan paid off by the time my wife and I plan to buy our own house, which should hopefully not affect our own home-buying process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/lzxyd2/inlaws_offering_to_buy_mobile_home_and_help_with/,1615146084.0,2,2,0
795,I Have An Outstanding PayPal Debt From 2018. What Is My Best Course Of Action?,"On February 23rd Jefferson Capital sent me a letter stating I owe $10,200 from an outstanding PayPal debt stemming from July 2018. In the interest of full disclosure: I knew it was out there; however, it slipped my mind due to COVID and other life happenings. Also, every time Jefferson Capital contacted me via telephone there was a man with a thick Indian accent on the other end of the line, so I was wary about sharing information.

In the letter, Jefferson Capital gave me a few different payment options. Option #1 was to pay $5,100 outright and the debt will be forgiven. Option #2 was to pay $472.00 in installments for 12 months and the debt would be forgiven. Given my current financial situation, option #2 sounds like the  most viable one; however, the statue of limitations on debts in my state of California says this debt will expire in 2022.

What do you guys think is the best option? Should I get on a payment plan and possibly reset the clock on my PayPal debt? Or should I let the PayPal debt expire and leave it be?

However, the account is marked as a closed account and is frequently reporting both that I made payments since 2015 (and as recently as 2019) and that I've been late since those on-time payments.

803,Will becoming an authorized user temporarily ding my credit?,"Hi! I opened 2 credit cards recently to build my credit. I expected a temporary ding of about 15-20 points, which happened initially, but when one of the cards popped up as a revolving account, my score went down even more. So far I'm down:

820 to 804 (from the hard pulls)

804 to 779 (presumably from the one new account). Experian says ""Too few accounts paid as agreed,"" which I'm assuming means thin file or young account age, since I have no late bills ever, and no fraud. Average account age at this point is 9 years, 5 months.

So I'm worried sick that the second account showing up on revolving will make my credit even worse. I'm so upset that I'm down 40+ points. Because of this, I asked my mum, who has phenomenal credit, to let me piggyback off two of her cards just in case the account age was the culprit. I'm piggybacking on one of her cards already.

But now I'm worried that this'll be the same as opening a new line of credit, and ding me even worse. Will this be the case? I can't seem to find info on this in the subreddit or by googling.

806,Ways to support my Autistic Younger Brother for life?,"Hey guys, recently made a post about taxes and this situation and you’ve been very helpful. 

I’m about to be 23 this year and my brother will turn 21. He was diagnosed with Autism at around 6 years old. He’s very high functioning but struggles with multitasking and understanding/processing information and replying back. What we call a “speech delay.”  I’ve recently graduated college and got employed in the Finance industry. He graduated high school. 

I’m going to be supporting him his entire life. He doesn’t have skills or the ability to do most “jobs.” He can’t be a cashier because he’ll mess up giving change, he can’t stock shelves because if a manager says to do something else, he’ll get confused and won’t understand. Due to these reasons, my plan is to save money from my job and purchase a business for him. 

For example, a liquor store or small convenience store where he can work alongside someone I trust and can be with him to guide him. This can be a family member or a trusted employee. The business can be anything, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions. 

Few facts about him: he’s very capable with everything. He can get ready by himself, he can drive a car (I don’t trust him fully alone yet). I made sure to patiently help him and get a drivers license. He has an AMAZING memory. If you tell him your birthday once, he’ll never forget the date for the remainder of his life. You show him a pattern or show him how to do something once, he’ll never forget. The only struggle to this is he gets messed up when there’s a sudden change. 

For example, if you show him how to get to the Apple Tree by driving through Main Street, he’ll do it by himself no problem. But the day that you tell him to go around Main Street due to a detour or something, he won’t comprehend and gets confused. If he ever gets pulled over by himself, he’ll struggle with explaining/communicating with the cop. He loves to follow a schedule. Ex. Lunch time between 12-2, snack time between 3-4 etc. if you come in one day with a reason to have lunch late, he’ll be like “it’s too late now” and just won’t comprehend that some days we can eat late or outside the “timings.” 

So, personal finance, my questions are: Is there a career path you guys can think of? If I purchase a business for him, should I make it under his name or should I have my own LLC and then have him under payroll and give him a “salary”? I’m prepared to take care of him my entire life. At the age of 16, I added his name to my first credit card and so his credit is great. No one can tell he’s autistic until you speak to him for a little bit and begin to notice the lack of comprehension. In an ideal world, his perfect job would be something where you do the same thing all day such as an assembly line or bagging groceries. I know the world is a cruel place where nobody will care for a kid like this and therefore I don’t want to expose him to anywhere where I feel he won’t be patiently treated.

807,Emergency Department (Fast Track) Medical Bill,"Hey, I recently visited the ED for some facial swelling and was prescribed some antibiotics. I was triaged into the Fast Track section (if that makes any difference.) It looks like the claim is still pending with my insurance company (Aetna, POS plan), but I'm seeing two bills on my account so far, one is for about $680 (I'm responsible for about $650) and the other is for about $700 (I'm responsible for about $25). 

My deductible is $400. In terms of co-insurance, my plan pays 85%. My copay for ED visits is $450. This is the first and only claim I've had with this insurance provider.

In total, I'm being told to pay $675 for this service. It seems a bit high for a rather simple ailment. I've only been to the ED once for an avulsed toe nail, which required a simple procedure as well as x-ray. The cost to me at that time was $50. However, this was with a different insurance provider many years ago.

Does this present charge sound correct? I'm still waiting for an explanation of benefits (EOB) document for this claim. I'm just trying to figure out why I have two claims open for this single encounter and why I'm being charged so much for a very brief and simple ED visit.

I was able to open a bank account at Chase pretty easily right after I arrived, but as it turns out, brick-and-mortar banks are the exception - every other online bank that I've looked at (Ally, Discover, SoFi, Chime, etc) all mention in their account holder agreements that you must be either a US citizen or a permanent legal resident to apply.

I also do graphic design and am eager to learn and work remote from home (if I find a home). 

The only idea I have is to sell my car and photo gear to earn some cash but in that case I can forget about photography and etc... So kinda stuck..

Tried freelancing, but as a newbie it is kinda difficult..

For now, to get some money to get by I do odd jobs, like washing cars and etc (as much as I can due to back pain)

I’ve actually only had small net losses before so this year is new for me. My main question is am I able to not file my stock trades for the year and just add them to 2021 taxes?

816,"New Home loan, issues with builder.","I am trying to use my credit union to finance the building of my new home. I was waiting on my preapproval letter ( I new it would be no issue to get approved) and told the builder that. They had one house left in the area that I could live in (real-estate has been crazy in my area) that was the model I liked so I signed a buyers contract and gave my deposit. The sales manager tried pushing hard for me to use their lender but he admitted the interest rate I would get through my credit union would be much better. 

A couple days later I supplied them with my pre-approval letter and a week after that I got a phone call from the sales manger wanting to know all the contact info for the credit union even though it's a well known credit union and the info was on the pre-approval letter. At this time he also again tried to push their lending company and tried some scare tactics etc but after I wouldn't fall for it he assured me he would contact the lender and all would be fine. Late last week I get a phone call in the middle of the work day from the sales manager that I had 14 days to supply them with some sort of documents that were needed from my bank and I have not done that and I will be in breachof the contract and the contract will be canceled. He wouldn't tell me what documents would be needed but that the fastest way to insure I don't loose the house is to go through his lender. 

My contract reads:

""Loan application/Credit reports:
If a buyer obtaining financing, Buyer aggress to make its loan application within four (4) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement and fully cooperate with Buyer's lender to obtain approval for a loan sufficient to finance the purchase of the Property (""Financing Approval"") . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein , if the Buyer fails to make appropriate application or fails to fully cooperate with lender in all respects, then Seller may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, terminate this Agreement and retain the Deposit as liquidated damages which is a reasonable estimate of Seller's damages, not a penalty.

If buyer is unable to obtain Financing approval, Buyer may give written notice (""Buyers Termination Notice"")  to Seller within fourteen (14) days after the Effective Date of this Agreement that Buyer wishes to terminate the Agreement due to Buyer's inability to obtain Financing Approval. In such event, Seller will refund the the Deposit. If Buyer does not give the Buyer's Termination Notice within the time required, this Agreement will no longer be contingent upon Financing Approval and will be fully binding on Buyer. Time is of the essence for this paragraph and strict compliance with the time for performance is required. 

Buyer herby authorizes its lender to disclose to Seller any and all credit, employment, income and other financial information concerning Buyer, such disclosure being  a waiver of any claim or cause of action of or concerning privacy rights, confidential information or otherwise.""

This is my first time building house so I am fully aware that it's very possible there is something along the way in this journey or building a new home that I am missing. Also if it matters this is not a custom home that I am building. The home is one that the builder owns the lot and was already in permitting to be built.

The pay makes sense, a decent monthly salary + commission per package.

The part that doesn't sit well with me is: If a company is gonna deliver a package to his place, wouldn't they just rather deliver it to it's destination and cut him out?

819,Help with refi options for 1st and 2nd mortgage," Hi All,

First time posting. I'm looking for advice before I start to request quotes for a refi. I'm including my goals, details, and a few questions and options to see if someone can help me make sense of this so I can make an educated plan.

Goal 1: Lower interest and monthly payments to free up available cash

Goal 2: Continue paying same monthly payment, pay off mortgage faster with easier access to cash, if needed

Details:

1st Mortgage: 30 Year, 5.25%, $112,000 left, about 10 years left on original loan, monthly payment $1,527/month.

2nd Mortgage: 30 Year, 7.84%, $87,000 left, about 20 years left on original loan, monthly payment $824/month.

Question 1: Should I combine my 1st and 2nd mortgage?

If I can combine them, I'm thinking the monthly payment would come way down and so would interest. Is this the right approach?

Question 2: Should I Refi into a 30-year fixed, estimate around 3.5%?

I understand interest charge would be higher if I paid off over 30 years but hoping to keep monthly payments the same and pay off faster but have more access to cash if needed. A 15 year would be higher monthly payment and less free cash and I could get the same effect by paying off more monthly.

Question 3: If I have 10 years left on 1st Mortgage should I refinance into a 30 year.

I'm wondering about this if I don't or can't combine 1st and 2nd mortgage, would it make much sense to refi or just keep as-is given closing and other costs.

Option 1, continue same monthly payment after refi combo at 3.5%

Paid off in about 8 yrs.

$112,000 + $87,000 = $199,000 @ 3.5% is monthly of $907, keep payments the same would be an extra $1,441, has a payoff on 30 year of about 8.16 years: (https://www.free-online-calculator-use.com/early-loan-payoff-calculator.html). I lose tax write off after 8 years, if paid off. Should I reduce the rate I accelerate payment to keep tax write off?

Option 2 invest extra $1,441/month, in 8 years I would have about $197,749.38.

@ 8-12 interest/year growth, 8 years of refi monthly payment we'd have $168,928 left to pay. $197, 749 - $168,928 = $168,179 $28,821 (not accounting for tax or capital gains)

(https://www.investor.gov/financial-tools-calculators/calculators/compound-interest-calculator). Is my math right? 8 years to potentially gain $28k with much higher risk in investing, I'm not sure it's worth the risk vs. much lower risk to pay off mortgage and have additional $2,348/month to invest in 8 years. Any insight here would be appreciated.

Every month, I am lucky to have additional cash left over and above those amounts to either (1) prepay the loans or (2) invest. 

Thoughts?  It feels silly to prepay the debt when it’s at such a low interest rate.  It also feels insane to be making taxable investments when I have so much debt.

826,(WA) simple Tax question,"Hello everyone!

Just getting around to filing my taxes and I have what I believe to be a quick/simple question.

I earned roughly $35,000 in 2020 and paid around $5,600 in federal income taxes. I usually earn about $2000/wk but unfortunately I only worked about 18/19 weeks in the year 2020 (I am backto working now fortunately) 

Because of this I was due back $3,000.

While I was off work I obviously collected unemployment.

My unemployment income was $36,623 and I had my federal income tax withheld (10%), which equaled about $3,666 being withheld.

When I entered this unemployment information into turbo tax, it immediately took that $3,000 I was due back and turned it into $300.

My question is, how come since I am withholding 10% of my unemployment income for federal tax, it wants me to pay an additional 13%?

This same exact thing happend last year, but since I was only collecting unemployment for a few weeks I didnt think twice about them withdrawing an additional $300",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m00tpv/wa_simple_tax_question/,1615154577.0,1,1,0
827,"Can't get rid of fraudulent tax lien on husband's credit. It could prevent us from buying our first home, something we've been working towards for a long time.","Not sure if this is the correct sub for this specific question, if not any ideas on where I could get some help on this would be grand. Ive already posted to r/legaladvice. 

TL;DR Husband has a tax lien on his credit bearing his name and the name of an unknown individual, for an address we've never lived at in a state we weren't living in at the time. We've given proof/evidence of these facts when asked, but nobody can do anything about having it removed or procuring a release. This could prevent us from buying our first home. 

My husband (38) and I (32) are trying to buy a house. We live in Tennessee. We've spent the better part of the last 2 years working on our debt and building his credit back up in order to do this. We started paperwork on a lovely home at the beginning of February this year. 

Everything's going fine until a week before we are due to close (our closing date is March 12). Our loan officer was supposed to send this sketch reporting on my husband's credit off to their credit company at the very beginning of all this (he didn't send it, unfortunately, or else we would at least have time on our side). The reporting is a tax lien bearing my husband's name and the name of an unknown individual, for an address we've never lived at in a state we weren't living in at the time (which is Arkansas). The IRS reported 109k in income to the State Department of Administration. The Social Security administration wages report shows the correct income of 35k. 

We provided the Arkansas Department of Finance Administration (where the lien is recorded) with all the proof and evidence they asked for (MVR (Drivers License record), and all pertinent W2's), and they are telling us they can't overturn IRS's reporting. But the IRS is not accepting fraud calls. You have to go to some place and fill out this form and they have, like, 180 days to get back to you. So now it's this huge issue to procure a lien release somehow, and failing to do so could keep us from getting the house. 

We are at a loss. It doesn't seem right that we should not be able to progress in our lives because of some fraudulent shit that's out of our hands, and we can't even seem to be able to fix it, which makes it feel all the more hopeless. Btw, no one seems to know who this unknown individual is whose name is on the lien.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/m00r52/cant_get_rid_of_fraudulent_tax_lien_on_husbands/,1615154370.0,1,1,0

829,Employers 401k pre taxed investment cap?,"Hi all,

I just recently (last year) got into retirement investing. I'm aiming for FIRE. I logged into my employers sponsored investor site and apparently my max contribution is only 10% for my pre taxed 401k?. Plan rules attached to this post. I did 10% for my first year randomly initially without reading the rules. Apparently the rule is 10% max. I decided I can comfortably double it to 20% without much financial burden and it says I've reached my max (10%), even though it's not even close to the IRS limit ($19,500).

It does however, offer me the option to invest (up to 100%) into a Roth (401k I think? Can anyone confirm?). I already max out my Roth IRA in my personal Vanguard account. What's my move here to eventually max out my 401k limits?

I'm assuming pre taxed investments would be better because I'll make less in retirement right? I wonder why they have this 10% cap rule for my 401k.

Apologies in advance if this is a dumb question. Thank you in advance.

Over the past few months I have started budgeting, cutting living expenses, and paying off debt. In my current situation I have my high interest credit card debt down to only $400, and should have this dealt with in 2 more weeks of paychecks. I have halted my contributions to investments until my debts are eradicated entirely. Here is the next 6 months however;

May 24, 2021: I begin my last apprenticeship schooling for my trade which runs for 10 weeks. During that time I will be collecting EI which cuts my monthly earnings after taxes in half. My plan is to start saving an emergency fund up until that time in order to coast me through those 10 weeks while being as frugal as possible. 

August 2021: At this point I am able to right my C of Q to become licensed in my trade, this will result in a significant pay bump as well.

Once licensed: At this point my apprentice loans begin to occur interest. (Average of prime rates which im estimating to be at least 14%) This loan is for $6000 CAD. 

After tax trades incentives: Over the next 6 - 8 months, I will receive roughly $2600 from Apprenticeship Incentive Grants. $880 from Union Incentives. The plan is to use all of this money towards the loan which is currently interest free. 

My question is how should I delegate my savings over the next 6 months to be prepared for an emergency, as well as preparing to pay 0% interest on the loan. My living expenses are around $2000 a month which I will receive from EI, but my cash flow won't be very good over that time to prepare for the debt of my loan. I'm pondering the idea of using a 0% interest credit card (10 month period) to pay off the remainder of my loan in August/ Sept. So I have another 10 months to pay off my loan interest free.

28 and trying to take a good look at my finances.

I currently have around $29,000 in student loan debt at 6.8% interest.

Option A: Refinance the full $29,000 at 3.33% fixed APR. $535/month for five years (which is a payment I'm comfortable making). Will pay $2600 total in interest (in contrast, without refinancing I will be paying $1980 a year on a tradition ten year payment plan in interest alone!)

Option B: Refinance $19,000. Keep $10,000 worth of student loans if Biden ever passes the $10,000 federal loan forgiveness.

Obviously federal student loans are at 0% until September. I can't figure out if this refinance rate is a steal I should just be thankful for and run with? Or should I leave $10,000 of loans?

I also am fully aware I'll lose all federal loan benefits with refinancing to a private bank and am fine with that.

860,Max SEP IRA contribution for self-employed person,"So, at first glance this seems simple - 25% of your Net profit.

But digging a little deeper I'm seeing that there's this circular equation where my income for this calculation is dependant on my max deductable contribution.

What I'm taking away from this is that my max deductable contribution is 20% of my net profit minus half of my self employment tax. Ok, so that's how much I can deduct.

But how much can I actually contribute?

Let's use numbers:
50,000 Profit
SE tax= (50000*0.9235)*0.153 = 7,065
Desired contribution rate = 25%
Max deductable contribution = 20% (from table in IRS publication 560)

So, the max deductable contribution would be:
(50,000 - 7,065/2)*0.2 = 9,293

But is my max contribution (regardless of how much I can deduct):

50,000*0.25 = 12,500
or
(50,000 - 7,065/2)*0.25 = 11,616

Reading IRS Publication 560 has not made this any clearer to me.

I am maxing out my Roth 401K at my employer (19,500) and my Roth IRA (6,000). The mega backdoor Roth is unavailable at my employer. Currently I make less than the Roth income limit but I will pass it it in the next one to three years. For this year, I project my side income to be around $15,000. I expect this to increase significantly each year.

My understanding is that I can only contribute approximately 20% of the side income to the Solo 401K (since I max out my employer's 401K), which wouldn't be much now but could be significant going forward. I want to do a Solo 401K instead of a SEP IRA because I don't want to prevent myself from doing the backdoor Roth when I pass the Roth IRA income limit.

Based on this information, should I open a Solo 401K now or wait until the side income is higher?

865,Trying to sort out 2021 tax withholding,"After doing our taxes for 2020, my wife and I found that we owe an additional $6000, because I switched jobs halfway through the year and ended up making more money than I was expecting, and did not add any extra withholding. I'm trying to sort out how we can avoid that next year, but our situation is pretty complicated, and I'm really having trouble figuring out how much we need to withhold. 

&#x200B;

We bought a house in December, had a baby in early February, and we switched from full time work to part time/per diem positions and paying for health insurance out of pocket after taxes. We've never itemized deductions before, but from what I'm calculating, we can expect:

&#x200B;

$17,150 in medical expenses (after-tax premiums and expenses for delivering the baby, which will be more than 7.5% of our income)

$10,000 SALT deduction for property taxes, hitting the cap

$11,400 in mortgage interest

Totaling $38,550, obviously much higher than the $24,500 standard deduction. Does that mean we can deduct that much on our taxes for 2021? If so, we might not end up getting hit with much of a tax bill, since that's a lot of extra deductions compared to the standard deduction, in addition to the child tax credit.

&#x200B;

Beyond that, we each work two jobs, one part time, and one per diem, at a high hourly rate with no benefits beyond a 401k through one of the part time jobs, which we'll be maxing out. Every paycheck is variable, but we expect to make about $170-180k this year. The IRS extra withholding calculator is... not very helpful with our situation.

&#x200B;

Any help on how we can even begin to figure out what our tax burden will be this year would be greatly appreciated! The bigger question I have, though, is just if I'm thinking about the itemized deductions correctly and can count on deducting that much from our 2021 taxes.

My wife and I are working towards purchasing a second house. We own the home we currently live in and plan to buy a second house that we would move into as our primary residence. We would then convert our current home into a rental once we move. 

From the DD I’ve done so far, it looks like the loan for the second house would require a 20% down. I’ve also read that lenders tend to require 3-6 months of cash on hand to cover the mortgage.

Have any of you found route to a smaller down payment requirement?

While are very diligent and responsible when it comes to personal finance/budgeting, we are not as knowledgeable about investing. We actually already have $20k+ saved up in a 'Baby fund' for medical expenses + getting ready for a baby.

880,Company's W2 goes from November 2019 to November 2020?," Hi all,

I moved around quite a bit during the year and because of that my company created my W2 following this ""other tax jurisdiction"" method, which basically means they calculated my W2 from November to November. Because of this, out of the 4 states where I lived in I only have a W2 for three of them as the last state was from mid-November to present.

How does this affect my filing?

For one, I'm unsure how to specify that my income being reported is from November to November - I'm using freetaxUSA and it only allows periods within 2020. Also, do I report income for the last state I lived in? According to my payroll department that income will be reported on my 2021 W2.

I am unsure how to proceed and my payroll department has offered no help beyond ""we're not tax professionals"" and refuse to recreate the W2 to reflect the entire year of 2020. I'm only a recent hire so I don't really have the money laying around to just hire a CPA to fix this for me.

882,Mortgage lender changing lender credits,"Can lender credits or fees change after you lock in a rate? I was calling two different lenders, call them A and B.  I told A what I think my property is worth and all my financial info. Lender A offered me 2.75% with $1276 lender credit.

I called lender B. I told B what I think the property is worth and all my financial info. He was actually able to look up a previous appraisal for my property and suggested I use that value instead of what I think the property is worth since the appraisal was only 10 months old. I said ok and he came back with an offer of 2.75% with around $1300 lender credit. So about the same offer.

While mulling over who I should go with, I got a call back (which I had requested because I had a question) from Lender A. Lender A told me that if I locked a rate with them that day they’d add $500 to the lender credit. So I took the offer.

I got on Lender A’s website and completed their application forms. When I looked at the loan estimate, however, the lender credits were listed as $1276. I called them to ask where the additional $500 was. I wasn’t able to talk with the person that had given me the offer. The person I did talk to said that the market conditions probably changed and that the additional $500 was included in the $1276. I asked for a call back from the person I had worked with. They called back and apologized for the mixup and changed the lender credits to reflect the additional $500.

I looked at the new LE and saw the lender credits were indeed $1776. So I locked the rate.

The next day I submitted my financial info and mentioned to the underwriter about the other lender using the property value per the last appraisal and if he wanted to do the same. I don’t think he really cared but he changed it anyways. Then I got a new loan estimate with the lender credits listed as $561. The underwriter said the credits could have gone away because he changed the property value. I thought this was weird since Lender B had used this value and came up with the same offer as Lender A. Well, I’m pretty sure my estimate of the house value is pretty accurate so I emailed him and had him change the property value back. He did except now the lender credits stayed at $561 to which he emailed that the lender credits are variable based on varying loan parameters such as debt-to-income and loan-to-value. He also said my estimate of the property value doesn't matter as they'll go with whatever the new appraisal says.

I’ve tried to call the underwriter and the loan officer several times to see what exactly is going on with the changed credits. Neither one of them will return my calls.

In addition, the monthly payment for the loan increased over their initial estimate because I live in an area with high taxes. So the higher monthly payment could have triggered the loss of lender credits because of a different debt/income ratio? 

Does this seem legit? How can you compare offers if the loan estimate can change after you lock? By this reasoning they can get you to lock at a certain rate and fees and then change them if the appraisal comes back a little low or high or the estimated monthly payment changes due to higher/lower actual taxes and insurance. And I don’t know what ever happened to the additional $500. It might have disappeared or it might still be included, I don’t know.  It just seems really convoluted.

Today, I woke up to a debit card transaction couldnt be processed notification from BOA which was not initiated by me. The location was CARD ACCPT IDC ST. LOUIS. I will get in touch with my bank soon.

My question to experts is: Can the scammers do any more harm with the debit card? I also read in the same old Reddit post that some had a fraudulent transaction pending on their new replacement cards! Is there any way to stop any activity for a replacement card or is it only possible to post any transaction once the mew card is in my hand after activation?

Also, if you are reading this, please lock your debit cards. I haven’t used my debit card in years anywhere, physical or online location.

Edit: called BOA customer care after holding on for 25 mins. They gave same generic response saying maybe a fraud transaction and applied for a new card with a $5 fee. I will lock this card and move my funds to a brokerage firm and just keep my 3 months emergency funds. Not having any trust in big banks anymore.

I got an email in January, so about five months after I was enrolled, saying that I had somehow accidentally (?) been enrolled in a 403(B) that does employee benefit contributions, rather than employer benefit contributions, so nothing had been accruing, and requesting that I re-enroll in the correct account, which I did immediately.

I have two questions: first, the incorrect employee benefit contribution account is still existing, so should I make sure that I unenroll from it, or does it make a difference? And second, I have no idea how the code I got somehow conveniently led me to create an employee contribution account, and I know I should have checked and followed up, but it also feels like my employer and HR department, who handles the TIAA system from their end, could have let me know.
