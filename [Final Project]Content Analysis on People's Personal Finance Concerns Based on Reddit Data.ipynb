However, Reddit has a limitation that it will only have at most ~1000 posts in each category (which is far more than a real person's reading ability) But it's not enough for computational analysis, especially for dynamic topic analysis in the later part. There are archived Reddit data on Google's Big Query platform, but it has stopped updated since 2019. So I decide to study the latest reddit post for the most part of this project, and use the archived historical reddit data in the dynamic topic modeling analysis."

The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.\\n\\n>The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.\\n\\n>In an announcement on Friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states — Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, New Jersey and Texas — were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.\\n\\n>In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.\\n\\nAs always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations. '"
